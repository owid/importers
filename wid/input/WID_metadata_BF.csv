Surveys are available for the following years: 1994, 1998, 2003, 2009, 2014. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2019 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.
