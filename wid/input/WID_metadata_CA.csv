The estimates of national accounts subcomponents in the WID are based on official country data and use the methodology presented in the [URL][URL_TEXT]DINA guidelines[\URL_TEXT][URL_LINK]https://wid.world/document/distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-2020-concepts-and-methods-used-in-the-world-inequality-database/[\URL_LINK][\URL]. We stress that these subcomponents estimates are more fragile than those of main aggregates such as national income. Countries may use classifications used are not always fully consistent with other countries or over time. Series breaks with no real economic significance can appear as a result. The WID include these estimates to provide a centralized source for this official data, so that it can be exploited more directly. We encourage users of this data to be careful and to pay attention to the source of the data, which we systematically indicate."
