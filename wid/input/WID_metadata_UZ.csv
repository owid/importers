The estimates of national accounts subcomponents in the WID are based on official country data and use the methodology presented in the [URL][URL_TEXT]DINA guidelines[\URL_TEXT][URL_LINK]https://wid.world/document/distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-2020-concepts-and-methods-used-in-the-world-inequality-database/[\URL_LINK][\URL].
