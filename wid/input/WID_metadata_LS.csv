Surveys are available for the following years: 1986, 1993, 1994, 2002, 2010, 2017. Income shares are interpolated linearly when surveys are available at the beginning and at the end of a given period. Inequality series are extrapolated backwards to 1990 and forwards to 2019 by keeping income shares constant when no data is available for these years.
