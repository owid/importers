KR;anninci999;999;i;Korea;National income;National income aims to measure the total income available to the residents of a given country. It is equal to the gross domestic product (the total value of goods and services produced on the territory of a given country during a given year), minus fixed capital used in production processes (e.g. replacement of obsolete machines or maintenance of roads) plus the net foreign income earned by residents in the rest of the world.// National income has many limitations, however it is the only income concept that has an internationally agreed definition (established by the United Nations System of National Accounts, see SNA 2008). We thus use it as our reference concept (after corrections to include income hidden in tax havens). // The national economy - in the national accounts sense - includes all domestic sectors, i.e. all entities that are resident of a given country (in the sense of their economic activity), whether they belong to the private sector, the corporate sector, the governement sector.;[National income]=[Net domestic product]+[Net foreign income];Average;Average income or wealth between two percentiles.

The amount of net personal wealth estimated here is much less than the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets. The difference could be explained as follows. First, the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets includes the asset of non-profit sector. Second, the estimate of net personal wealth covers only real estate and financial assets, while other kinds of assets are included in the National Balance Sheets. Third, while the real estates in the National Balance Sheets are those in market prices, they are in government appraisal values, lower than market prices. Considering the share of real estate in the net household wealth is 76% (the average in 2000-2013)  and the total amount in government appraisal values is 67% of that in market prices, the net household wealth would be underestimated as much as 25% at least from the difference in government appraisal values and market prices of real estate.

The amount of net personal wealth estimated here is much less than the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets. The difference could be explained as follows. First, the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets includes the asset of non-profit sector. Second, the estimate of net personal wealth covers only real estate and financial assets, while other kinds of assets are included in the National Balance Sheets. Third, while the real estates in the National Balance Sheets are those in market prices, they are in government appraisal values, lower than market prices. Considering the share of real estate in the net household wealth is 76% (the average in 2000-2013)  and the total amount in government appraisal values is 67% of that in market prices, the net household wealth would be underestimated as much as 25% at least from the difference in government appraisal values and market prices of real estate.
