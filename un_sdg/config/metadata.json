    "metadata": "Definition: \nSDG 11.6 targets an improved environmental performance of cities and SDG indicator 11.6.1 measures \nthe progress of the performance of a city\u2019s municipal solid waste management. It quantifies the \nparameters listed below, which are essential for planning and implementing sustainable Municipal Solid \nWaste (MSW). In most cases, these variables are generally compatible with those collected through the \nUNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics (waste section). \n\na)  Total MSW generated in the city (tonnes/day) \nb)  Total MSW collected in the city (tonnes/day) \nc)  Proportion of population with access to basic MSW collection services in the city (%) \nd)  Total MSW managed in controlled facilities in the city (tonnes/day) \ne)  MSW composition \n\nIt is important to realize that part (b) total MSW collected and (c) proportion of the population with \naccess to basic MSW collection services are two different concepts. While part (b) refers to amounts of \nwaste reaching waste management facilities, part (c) considers the population who receive waste \ncollection services. In some cities it is common to dump waste \u2018collected\u2019 from households into the \nsurrounding areas instead of transporting it to a disposal or recovery facility. In this case the household \nhas waste collection services, but the collected waste is polluting the environment. Therefore, it is \npossible that a city has a high proportion of population with access to basic waste collection services, but \nthe amount of MSW collected and transported to waste management facilities is low.  \n\nAlthough part (c)  is covered by SDG 1 (\u201cEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\u201d), under target 1.4 and \nSDG indicator 1.4.1 which focuses on universal access to basic services, with a particular emphasis on \npoor and vulnerable groups, this document provides guidelines, quality ladders and household \nquestionnaires to measure the proportion of the population with access to \u2018basic\u2019 MSW collection \nservices. The household questionnaire can be integrated into the national census or global household \nsurvey mechanism such as Demographic and Health Survey or UNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster \nSurveys. Due to the lack of standardized concepts and definitions that differentiate these two concepts, \nmany cities report the proportion of collected MSW in their own terms. Therefore, this metadata \ndistinguishes clearly between part (b) and (c) and offers introduction to the approaches to monitor and \nreport on part (c).   \nRationale: \nUrban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste that must be collected \nregularly, recycled or treated and disposed properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living \nconditions. Many cities are increasingly facing solid waste management challenges due to rapid \nurbanization, lack of technical and financial capacity or low policy priority. In addition, the higher the \nincome level of a city, the greater the amount of the solid waste produced. Therefore, the economic \ngrowth to be experienced in the developing and emerging countries will pose greater challenges in solid \nwaste management to local governments in the next decades. \n \nAdverse environmental impact of uncollected waste in a city is significant. Uncollected solid waste can \nend up in drains leading to blocked drainages and cause unsanitary conditions that have a direct health \nimpact on residents. Open burning of uncollected waste produces pollutants that are highly damaging \nlocally and globally. Vectors such as mosquitos usually breed in blocked drainages and blocked drainage \ncontributes to the cause of flooding. In 2015, the Global Waste Management Outlook estimated that at \nleast 2 billion people do not have access to regular waste collection. This is particularly worse in informal \nsettlements and the UN-Habitat\u2019s report Solid Waste Management in World Cities published in 2010 \nestimated only 5% of waste in squatter areas is regularly collected.   \n \nThe global scale of urbanization and economic growth are creating a potential \u201ctime-bomb\u201d regarding the \nwaste we generate in the world. If not addressed now, the significant negative impact on human health \nand the environment will be felt by nations at all levels of development. An estimated 2 billion tonnes of \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) were generated in 2016, and this number is expected to grow to 3.4 billion \ntonnes by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario (Worldbank, 2018). Uncontrolled disposal sites are \nalready a major source of Green House Gases (GHG), and if we continue on the current path the waste \nsector, particularly food waste, is predicted to account for 8-10% of global anthropogenic GHG emission \nby 2025. Additionally, every year at least 8 million tonnes of plastic find its way into the world\u2019s oceans \n(Jambeck et al., 2015). \n\nThere is a need for SDG indicator 11.6.1 monitoring as it provides critical information for cities and \ncountries to establish better waste and resource management strategies. Reliable data and information \non MSW generation and management is limited globally, especially in low- and middle-income country \nsettings where waste data is often produced based on international estimates, without having been \nvalidated in the local context.  \n\nMany developing and transitional country cities still have an active informal sector and micro-enterprise \nrecycling, reuse and repair; often achieve recycling and recovery rates comparable to those in developed \ncountries, resulting in savings to the waste management budget of the cities. There is a major \nopportunity for the city to build on these existing recycling systems, reducing some unsustainable \npractices and enhancing them to protect and develop people\u2019s livelihoods, and to reduce still further the \ncosts to the city of managing the residual wastes. The formal and informal sectors need to work together, \nfor the benefit of both. Promoting this indicator also can help formalization of the informal sector in the \nprocess of increasing the portion of \u2018solid waste with adequate discharge\u2019.  \n \n\nA global data collection and publication system through the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment \nStatistics has collected data on MSW collection and treatment for about 20 years. The Questionnaire has \nbeen sent to more than 160 countries, covering both national and city levels. However, the response rate for the UNSD/UNEP questionnaire is around 50% and data completeness and quality remain a challenge, \nespecially for developing countries. While efforts will continue to collect data from National Statistical \nOffices and Ministries of Environment at the national level, it is also critical to improve the availability and \naccessibility of waste statistics and increase training for collection of data and capacity development at \nthe national and sub-national levels. \n\nThis paucity of evidence-based data hinders the development of waste management strategies and \nconstrains investment decision-making in infrastructure and service expansion, leading to many countries \nhaving insufficient or absent MSW management services. Poor MSW collection and management trigger \nsevere threats to public health and pollute air and water. Furthermore, uncollected and mismanaged \nwaste is the main source of marine plastic pollution. \n\nThe indicator 11.6.1 will also promote Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM). An integrated solid \nwaste management system is strongly connected to three dimensions: urban environmental health, the \nenvironment and resource management. Moreover, a regular solid waste management strategy is a clear \nindicator of the effectiveness of a municipal administration. Good waste governance that is inclusive, \nfinancially sustainable and based on sound institutions is one of the key challenges of the 21st century, \nand one of the key responsibilities of a city government. \n \nSDG indicator 11.6.1 quantifies parameters that will help cities and countries to better manage resources, \nmitigate and prevent environmental pollution, create business, employment and livelihood \nopportunities, and shift towards a circular economy. The methodology to monitor SDG indicator 11.6.1 \nprovides guidelines for ladders for MSW collection services and control level of waste management \nfacilities and aims to bring standardization around MSW data points. \n\nThe indicator 11.6.1 has strong linkages to other SDG indicators such as 6.3.1 (proportion of wastewater \nsafely treated), 12.3.1 (food waste), 12.4.2 (Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of \nhazardous waste treated and by type of treatment) and 12.5.1 (National recycling rate).   \nUN-Habitat has also developed an additional document Waste Wise Cities Tool - Step by Step Guide to \nAssess a City\u2019s MSWM Performance through SDG indicator 11.6.1 Monitoring which provides detailed \nmethodology for data collection if not available.  \n\n \n \n \n \nConcepts: \n \n\nMunicipal Solid Waste (MSW) \nMunicipal Solid Waste includes waste generated from: households, commerce and trade, small \nbusinesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes \nbulky waste (e.g. white goods, old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g. \nwaste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the \ncontent of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. The definition excludes waste \nfrom municipal sewage network and treatment, municipal construction and demolition waste. Generation \nTotal MSW Generated is the sum of the amount of municipal waste collected plus the estimated amount \nof municipal waste from areas not served by a municipal waste collection service. \n\nCollection \nTotal MSW Collected refers to the amount of municipal waste collected by or on behalf of municipalities, \nas well as municipal waste collected by the private sector. It includes mixed waste, and fractions collected \nseparately for recovery operations (through door-to-door collection and/or through voluntary deposits).\n\nFigure 1: What MSW collected means for SDG indicator 11.6.1 \n\nThe proportion of the population with Access to Basic MSW Collection Services is the proportion of the \npopulation who receive waste collection services that are either basic, improved or full, defined by the \nservice ladder of MSW collection service. It considers aspects of frequency, regularity and proximity of \nthe collection points ( \n\n \n\nTable 1). This aspect is measured under the SDG indicator 11.6.1 assessment but it is reported through a \ndifferent indicator, SDG 1.4.1. on access to basic services. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Ladder of MSW collection service that household receives \n\nSERVICE \nLEVEL \n\nFull \n\nDEFINITION \n\n\uf06f  Receiving door-to-door MSW collection service with basic frequency and regularity and MSW is \n\ncollected in three or more separate fractions; or \uf06f  Having a designated collection point within 200m distance served with basic frequency and \n\nregularity and without major littering and MSW is collected in three or more separate fractions    \n\n\uf06f  Receiving door-to-door MSW collection service with basic frequency and regularity and MSW is \n\ncollected in a minimum of two, separate fractions (eg. wet and dry fractions)  \n\n\uf06f  Having a designated collection point within 200m distance served with basic frequency and \nregularity and without major littering and MSW is collected in a minimum of two, separate \nfractions (eg. wet and dry fractions)  \n\n\uf06f  Receiving door-to-door MSW collection service with basic frequency and regularity or \n\uf06f  Having designated collection point within 200m distance served with basic frequency and \n\n\uf06f  Receiving door-to-door MSW collection service without basic frequency and regularity; \n\uf06f  Having a designated collection point within 200m distance but not served with basic frequency \n\nregularity \n\nand regularity; or  \n\n\uf06f  Having designated collection point in further than 200 m distance. \n\uf06f  Receiving no waste collection service  \n\nNo \nNote: Basic frequency and regularity: served at least once a week for one year \n\nImproved \n\nBasic \n\nLimited \n\n \n\nRecovery \nRecovery means any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by \nreplacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste \nbeing prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy. \n\nRecovery facilities include any facility with recovery activities defined above including recycling, \ncomposting, incineration with energy recovery, materials recovery facilities (MRF), mechanical biological \ntreatment (MBT), etc. \n\nMaterial Recovery Facility (MRF; or materials reclamation facility, materials recycling facility, multi re-use \nfacility) is a specialized recovery facility that receives, separates and prepares recyclable materials for \nmarketing to further processors or end-user manufacturers. \n\nMechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) facilities are a type of recovery facility that combines an MRF \nwith a form of biological treatment such as composting or anaerobic digestion. \n\nIncineration is the controlled combustion of waste with or without energy recovery. \n\nIncineration with Energy Recovery is the controlled combustion of waste with energy recovery. \n\nRecycling is defined under the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire and further for the purpose of these indicators \nas \u201cAny reprocessing of waste material in a production process that diverts it from the waste stream, \nexcept reuse as fuel.  Both reprocessing as the same type of product, and for different purposes should \nbe included. Recycling within industrial plants i.e., at the place of generation should be excluded.\u201d For the \npurpose of consistency with the Basel Convention reporting and correspondence with EUROSTAT \nreporting system, Recovery operations R2 to R12 listed in Basel Convention Annex IV, are to be \nconsidered as \u2018Recycling\u2019 under the UNSD reporting for hazardous waste.  \n\nRecycling value chain usually involves several steps of the private recycling industry which purchase, \nprocess and trade materials from the point a recyclable material is extracted from the waste stream until \nit will be reprocessed into products, materials or substances that have market value. In many low and \nlow-to-middle income countries, this involves informal waste pickers, many middlemen, traders, apex \ntraders and end-of-chain recyclers.  Apex traders collect recyclable materials from different sources and suppliers (in different cities across \nmunicipal or even national boundaries) and supply them to different end-of-chain recyclers (sometimes \nafter pre-processing such as sorting, washing and bailing). \n\nEnd-of-chain recyclers purchase recyclable material from suppliers such as apex traders and reprocess it \ninto products, materials, or substances that have market value.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Complexity in the recovery chain (plastic example) \n\nDisposal \nDisposal means any operation whose main purpose is not the recovery of materials or energy even if the \noperation has as a secondary consequence the reclamation of substances or energy.  \n\nDisposal Facilities refer to sites which are regularly used by the public authorities and private collectors, \nregardless of their level of control and legality, to dispose of waste. Such sites may or may not have an \nofficial recognition, a permit or a license.  Disposal sites may be managed in either a controlled or \nuncontrolled manner. The definition excludes other unrecognized places where waste is deposited \noccasionally in small amounts which public authorities may organise clean ups to remove the waste from \nthese sites. \n\nLandfill is the deposit of waste into or onto land. It includes specially engineered landfill sites and \ntemporary storage of over one year on permanent sites. The definition covers both landfills at internal \nsites, i.e. where a generator of waste is carrying out its own waste disposal at the place of generation, \nand at external sites. \n\nControl level of MSW recovery and disposal facilities \nMSW Managed in Controlled Facilities refers to MSW collected and transported to recovery and disposal \nfacilities with basic, improved or full control according to the Ladder of waste management facilities\u2019 \ncontrol level (Table 2: Ladder of waste management facilities\u2019 control level.Table 2). The Ladder can be used as a \nchecklist for assessing the level of control of a particular recovery or disposal facility. The facility has the \nlevel of control, where it checks the most boxes. Note that the emphasis is on operational control rather \n\n\fthan engineering/design. A facility that is constructed to a high standard, but not operated in compliance \nwith Level 3 (or above) standard is not regarded as a controlled facility.    \n\nTable 2: Ladder of waste management facilities\u2019 control level. \n\nLast updated: 15 September 2020 \n\nOther recovery facilities \n\n\uf06f  Built to and operating in \ncompliance with current \nnational laws and standards  \n\uf06f  Pollution  control  compliant \nto environmental standards \n\n\uf06f  Protection of workers\u2019 \nhealth and safety \n\uf06f  The nutrient value of \nbiologically treated \nmaterials utilized for \nseparate organic waste (e.g. \nin agriculture/horticulture) \n\n\uf06f  Materials are extracted, \nprocessed according to \nmarket specifications, and \nsold to recycling markets \n\uf06f  Weighing and recording of \nincoming loads conducted  \n\uf06f  All outgoing loads registered \n\nby weight and type of \ndestination \n\n\uf06f  Engineered facilities with \neffective process control \n\uf06f  Pollution control compliant \nto environmental standards \n\n\uf06f  Protection of workers\u2019 \nhealth and safety \n\uf06f  Evidence of materials \n\nextracted being delivered \ninto recycling or recovery \nmarkets. \n\n\uf06f  Weighing and recording of \nincoming and outgoing \nloads conducted \n\n\uf06f  Registered facilities with \nmarked boundaries \n\n\uf06f  Some environmental \npollution control \n\uf06f  Provisions made for \n\nworkers\u2019 health and safety \n\uf06f  Weighing and recording of \nincoming and outgoing \nloads conducted \n\nCONTROL \nLEVEL \n Full \nControl \n\nLandfill site \n\n\uf06f  Waste daily covered  \n\uf06f  Waste compacted \n\uf06f  Site fenced and full 24-\nhour control of access \n\n\uf06f  Properly sited, designed \nand functional sanitary \nlandfill  \n\n\uf06f  Leachate containment and \ntreatment (naturally \nconsolidated clay on the \nsite or constructed liner) \n\uf06f  Landfill gas collection and \nflaring and/or utilization  \n\n\uf06f  Site staffed;

MSWM activities are carried out by formal and informal economic \nunits, both public and private, and by generators for the purpose of prevention, collection, \ntransportation, treatment and disposal of waste. \n\nFormal waste management relates to waste management activities undertaken by units working within \nthe context of the formal governmental or non-state actors regulating and operating waste management; \nthat is, organisations or individuals registered as economic units with government authorities and \nassumed to generally abide by local laws and regulations related to wastes and their management.  \n\nInformal waste management, recycling and recovery refers to waste management and recovery \nactivities undertaken by individuals, economic units, or enterprises which are not sponsored, financed, \nrecognised, supported, organised or acknowledged by the formal solid waste authorities, or which \noperate in violation of or in competition with formal authorities (Scheinberg et al., 2010). Informal units \nare assumed to abide by local waste-related laws and regulations when it is in their interests to do so. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nCollection of data for the indicator is very much possible as demonstrated by pilot data collection using \nUN-Habitat\u2019s Waste Wise Cities Tool in Mombasa (see flow diagram), but continuous training and \ncapacity development for tool application at city level will be required to strengthen the global waste \nstatistics and improve its data quality. In general, developed countries have good Municipal solid waste \ndata collection systems.

What distinguishes this \n\n3  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nindicator from Indicator 16.1.1 (number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population \nby sex and age) aside from the broader scope of violent incidents, is the motivation or causal \nfactor, i.e. that the violation was motivated by the victim having stood up to defend the rights of \nothers, exercise fundamental freedoms, or have occurred while the victim was engaged in such \nactivities. Alongside indicator 16.10.2 (number of countries that adopt and implement \nconstitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) this indicator \nprovides both a micro and macro-level snapshot of the state of the aforementioned fundamental \nfreedoms in various contexts, as well as a link to the processes and structures required to meet \nhuman rights obligations with respect to those fundamental freedoms. \n\nConcepts: \n\nThe operational definitions of the cases, victims and other elements of the indicator have been \npatterned as far as practicable after corresponding categories in ICCS. The task of classifying cases \nentails observing events from both statistical standards and international law perspectives. For \nexample, intentional homicide (ICCS code 0101) is included as a component of the violation type \n\u2018killing\u2019 and is in turn supplemented by applicable human rights standards: \n\n\u2022  0101 Intentional homicide. Inclusions: murder; serious assault leading to death; femicide ; \nhonour killing; voluntary manslaughter; killings caused by excessive use of force by law \nenforcement officials; extrajudicial and extra-legal, summary or arbitrary executions. \n[human rights standards added in italics] \n\nThis conceptual approach is necessitated by the confluence of three factors. First is the principle \nthat all the violent acts tracked by the indicator are motivated by the exercise of fundamental \nfreedoms that are guaranteed by human rights law to all persons. Second, while human rights \nabuses are not always explicitly criminalized in domestic jurisdictions, ICCS has achieved a certain \nlevel of success in terms of integrating human rights elements in the classification of crimes. \nThird, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislation or practices, all events \u2013 whether \nordinary crimes or human rights violations \u2013 that meet the elements provided in the definitional \nframework will be counted for statistical purposes. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nAs for other crime statistics and other statistics based on administrative sources, this indicator is \nsensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. There is a real but manageable \nrisk of underreporting. Moreover, reporting rates and statistical accuracy are influenced by \nvarious factors, including changes and biases in victim reporting behaviour, changes in police and \nrecording practices or rules, new laws, processing errors and non-responsive institutions. \nRegional and global aggregates may underestimate the true incidence and vol ume of \nvictimization, overcompensate for robust and inclusive national data collection systems . In most \ninstances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and \nperseverance of national stakeholders, of human rights defenders themselves, and the \ncorresponding support of the international community. \n\n4  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n"

At the start of the MDG period, \nthere was a complete lack of nationally representative data about drinking water safety in developing \ncountries, and such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP developed \nthe concept of \u2018improved\u2019 water sources, which was used as a proxy for \u2018safe water\u2019, as such sources are \nlikely to be protected against faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track \nprogress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on \nthe need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative \ncriteria of the human right to water including accessibility, availability and quality. \n \nThe above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of access and address safe \nmanagement of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The \nproposed indicator of \u2018safely managed drinking water services\u2019 is designed to address this. \n \nConcepts: \n \nImproved drinking water sources include the following: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public \ntaps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; \ndelivered water and rainwater.  \n \nA water source is considered to be \u2018located on premises\u2019 if the point of collection is within the dwelling, \nyard, or plot. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\n \n\u2018Available when needed\u2019: households are able to access sufficient quantities of water when needed. \n \n\u2018Free from faecal and priority chemical contamination\u2019: water complies with relevant national or local \nstandards.

The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality \nhealth services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. \nTwo indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for \nhealth service coverage, which is operationalized with an index that combines 16 health service coverage \nindicators for reproductive, maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, \nand service capacity and access into a single summary metric. Indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health \nexpenditures in relation to a household\u2019s budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health \ncare payments. Taken together, indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and \nfinancial protection dimensions, respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always \nmonitored jointly. \n \nIndicator 3.8.2 derives from methodologies dating back to the 1990s developed in collaboration with \nacademics at the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying \npeople that need to devote a substantial share of their total household expenditure or income to health \ncare. The focus is on payments made at the point of use to get any type of treatment, from any type of \nprovider, for any type of disease or health problem, net of any reimbursements to the individual who \nmade the payment but excluding pre-payments for health services; for example, in the form of taxes or \nspecific insurance premiums or contributions. Such direct payments are the least equitable way to \nfinance the health systems given that they determine the extent of care received.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nThis is clearly against the spirit of the target, which calls for granting access based on health needs not a \nhousehold\u2019s capacity to pull together all its financial resources to meet the health needs of its members. \nSome direct payments might be needed but indicator 3.8.2 is underpinned by the conviction that no one, \nat whatever income level, should have to choose between spending on health and spending on other \nbasic goods and services such as education tuitions, food necessities, housing and utilities. One way of \nassessing the extent to which health systems lead to financial hardship is to calculate the proportion of \nthe population with large household expenditures on health as a share of household total consumption \nor income.  For detailed information on the definition chosen to monitor the financial protection \ndimension of universal health coverage within the SDG monitoring framework (indicator 3.8.2) please \nconsult   Wagstaff et al. (2018) and chapter 2 in the WHO and World Bank report on \u201cTracking universal \nhealth coverage: 2017 global monitoring report\u201d. \n \nConcepts: \n \nIndicator 3.8.2 is defined as the \u201cProportion of the population with large household expenditure on \nhealth as a share of total household expenditure or income\u201d. In effect it is based on a ratio exceeding a \nthreshold. The two main concepts of interest behind this ratio are household expenditure on health \n(numerator) and total household consumption expenditure or, when unavailable, income (denominator).  \n \nNumerator \nHousehold expenditure on health is defined as any expenditure incurred at the time of service use to get \nany type of care (promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) including all \nmedicines, vaccines and other pharmaceutical preparations as well as all health products, from any type \nof provider and for all members of the household. These health expenditures are characterized by a direct \npayments that are financed by a household\u2019s income (including remittances), savings or loans but do not \ninclude any third-party payer reimbursement. As such they only grant access to the health services and \nhealth products individuals can pay for, without any solidarity between the healthy and the sick beyond \nthe household1 and solely based on the willingness and ability of the household to pay. Direct health care \npayments are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing \nschemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). OOP health expenditures are \nthe most unequitable source of funding for the health system.   \n \nThe components of a household\u2019s health care consumption expenditure so defined should be consistent \nwith division 06 on health of the UN Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose \n(COICOP) which currently  includes expenditures on medicines and medical products (06.1), outpatient \ncare services (06.2) and inpatient care services (06.3) but is being expanded2. \n \nFurther information on definitions and classifications (for example by provider, by beneficiary \ncharacteristics) of health expenditures should be consistent with the international classification for health \naccounts and its family of classifications. ICHA results from collaboration between OECD, Eurostat and the \nWorld Health Organization.   \n \n\n                                                           \n1 http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/a-system-of-health-accounts/classification-of-health-care-\nfinancing-schemes-icha-hf_9789264116016-9-en   \n2 Agenda item 3(l) available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/; \nhttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=5&Lg=1&Co=06.1  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nDenominator \nExpenditure on household consumption and household income are both monetary welfare measures. \nHousehold consumption is a function of permanent income, which is a measure of a household\u2019s long-\nterm economic resources that determine living standards. Consumption is generally defined as the sum \nof the monetary values of all items (goods and services) consumed by the household on domestic \naccount during a reference period. It includes the imputed values of goods and services that are not \npurchased but procured otherwise for consumption. Information on household consumption is usually \ncollected in household surveys that may use different approaches to measure \u2018consumption\u2019 depending \non whether items refer to durable or non-durable goods and/or are directly produced by households. \n \nThe most relevant measure of income is disposable income as it is close to the maximum available to the \nhousehold for consumption expenditure during the accounting period. Disposable income is defined as \ntotal income less direct taxes (net of refunds), compulsory fees and fines. Total income is generally \ncomposed of income from employment, property income, income from household production of services \nfor own consumption, transfers received in cash and goods, transfers received as services3.  \n \nIncome is more difficult to measure accurately due to its greater variability over time. Consumption is less \nvariable over time and easier to measure. It is therefore recommended that whenever there is \ninformation on both household consumption and income the former is used (see the \u201ccomments and \nlimitations\u201d section to learn more about the sensitivity of 3.8.2 to the income/expenditure choice in the \ndenominator). Statistics on 3.8.2 currently produced by WHO and the World Bank predominantly rely on \nconsumption (see section on data sources).  \n \nThresholds \nIt is recommended to use two thresholds for global reporting to identify large household expenditure on \nhealth as share of total household consumption or income: a lower threshold of 10% (3.8.2_10) and a \nhigher threshold of 25% (3.8.2_25). With these two thresholds the indicator measures financial hardship  \n (see section on comments and limitations).     \n \nComments and limitations: \nIt is feasible to monitor indicator 3.8.2 on a regular basis using the same household survey data that is \nused to monitor SDG target 1.1 and 1.2 on poverty4. These surveys are also regularly conducted for other \npurposes such as calculating weights for the Consumer Price Index. These surveys are conducted typically \nby NSOs. Thus, monitoring the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health \nas a share of total household consumption or income does not add any additional data collection burden \nso long as the health expenditure component of the household non-food consumption data can be \nidentified. While this is an advantage, indicator 3.8.2 suffers from the same challenges of timeliness, \nfrequency, data quality and comparability of surveys than SDG indicator 1.1.1.  However, indicator 3.8.2 \nhas its own conceptual and empirical limitations. \n \nFirst, indicator 3.8.2 attempts to identify financial hardship that individuals face when using their income, \nsavings or taking loans to pay for health care. However, most household surveys fail to identify the source \nof funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no \nretrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. If a household does \n\n                                                           \n3 http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/17thicls/r2hies.pdf   \n4 http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-01-01a.pdf   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2019 \n\nreport any expenditure on health, it would be because it is not going to be reimbursed by any third-party \npayer. It is therefore consistent with the definition given for direct health care payments (the numerator).  \nFor those countries on the other hand where there is retrospective reimbursement \u2013 for example, via a \ncontributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures \nmight be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the \nhousehold survey.  \n \nClearly, more work is needed to ensure that survey instruments gather information on the sources of \nfunding used by the household to pay for health care, or the household survey instrument always \nspecifies that health expenditures should be net of any reimbursement.  \n \nSecond, in the current definition of indicator 3.8.2 large health expenditures can be identified by \ncomparing how much household spend on health to either household income or total household \nexpenditure. Expenditure is the recommended measure of household\u2019s resources (see concept section) \nbut recent empirical work has demonstrated that while statistics on 3.8.2 at country level are fairly \nrobust to such choice, their disaggregation by income group is pretty sensitive to it. Income based \nmeasures show a greater concentration  of the proportion of the population with large household \nexpenditure on health among the poor than expenditure based measures (see chapter 2 in  the WHO and \nWorld Bank 2017 report on tracking universal health coverage   as well as Wagstaff et al 2018) . \n \nThird, indicator 3.8.2. relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes \u2018large health expenditure \nas a share of total household expenditure or income\u2019. People just below such threshold are not taken into \naccount, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. This is simply avoided by plotting \nthe cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio behind 3.8.2. By doing so, it is \npossible to identify for any threshold the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its \nhousehold\u2019s budget to health.  \n \nFourth, indicator 3.8.2. is based on measures of ex-post spending on health care. Low levels of spending \ncould be driven by measurement errors due to both non-sampling errors such as a very short recall \nperiod that does not allow the collection of information on health care requiring an overnight stay; or \nsampling errors such as over-sample of areas with a particularly low burden of disease. No spending \ncould also be due to people not being able to spend anything on health which, at least for the services \nthat are included in 3.8.1, should result in low levels of coverage.  \n \nThere are other indicators used to measure financial hardship. WHO uses  a framework  which includes , \nin addition to indicator 3.8.2, a definition of large health expenditure in relation to non-subsistence \nspending5,6,7,. \n\n                                                           \n5 Chapter 2 in \u201cTracking universal health coverage: 2017 global monitoring report\u201d, World Health Organization and \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development/  The World Bank; 2017; \nhttp://www.who.int/healthinfo/indicators/2015/en/ ;  \n6Xu, K., Evans, D.

In \nthe case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental \nimpacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social \nbenefits.  \n\n \nMaking progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation \nof such policy instruments.   \n \nRationale: \nMainstreaming sustainable consumption and production in decision-making at all levels is a core function \nof the 10-Year Framework, which is expected to \u201csupport the integration of sustainable consumption and \nproduction into sustainable development policies, programmes and strategies, as appropriate, including, \nwhere  applicable,  into  poverty  reduction strategies\u201d  (Rio+20 Outcome  Document  \u2013  A/CONF.216/5).  The \npurpose  of  this  indicator  is  to  help  assess  the  volume  and  geographical  repartition  of  governments \nprogressing on sustainable consumption and production. In addition, further information is being collected \non the types, focus and orientation of the policy instruments that are being developed and used, to monitor \n\n1 UNEP (2010).

This \nshould  support  evaluation  of  how  much  /  how  fast  governments  progress  in  the  development  and \napplication of  policies  addressing  sustainable  consumption and  production, whether  at  cross-cutting  or \nsectoral level. \n \nThe indicator is also considering both binding (laws and regulations) and non-binding policy instruments. \nThe first category is essential to the shift, as binding instruments provide the legal ground for sustainable \nconsumption and production, and can be used for enforcement or to provide incentives. The ability to \ndevelop, pass and implement legislation is an indication of jurisdictions\u2019 engagement in the shift towards \nsustainable consumption and production. This indicator can also help monitor the evolution of the global \nlegislative landscape. The second category is also essential to ensure institutional engagement, \ncommitment and ownership. In some cases, non-binding policy instruments can lead to the creation of \nnew legal ones. The development and implementation of non-binding instruments across sectors also \nprovides information on engagement of partners and other stakeholders in sustainable consumption and \nproduction. \n \nConcepts: \nAs mentioned above, policy instruments are distinguished in legally binding policies and non-legally \nbinding ones. \n\u2022 \n\nLegally  binding:  a  legally  binding  policy  instrument  refers  to  a  system  of  rules,  procedures  and/or \nprinciples which are prescribed and enforced by a governing authority with the aim of requiring or \npreventing  specific  actions  or  providing  incentives  that  lead  to  change  in  actions  or  preferences.  It \nincludes:  laws,  regulations,  standards,  by-laws,  codes,  etc.  They  can  relate  to  different  types  of \njurisdictions such as a ministry, state, municipality, or group of states.  \n\n\u2022  Non-binding:  a  non-binding  policy  instrument  refers  to  a  coherent  set  of  decisions  associated  to  a \ncommon vision, objective and/or direction, and to a proposed course of action to achieve these. It \nincludes,  for  instance:  action  plans,  policies,  strategies,  programmes,  and  projects.  They  can  have \ndifferent scopes of application (international, national, local, etc.). \n\n\u2022  At another level, different categories of policy instruments can be distinguished:   \no  Macro policies (e.g. national strategies/action plans, new institutions/entities) \no  Regulatory and legal instruments (e.g. laws, standards, enforcement measures) \no  Economic and fiscal instruments (taxes and tax incentives, grants, preferential loans, etc.)  \no  Voluntary  and  self-regulation  schemes  (e.g.  sectoral  partnerships,  codes  of  conduct,  CSR \n\ninitiatives) \n\n \n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that,  except  for  regulatory  /  legal  instruments  and  voluntary  /  self-regulation \nschemes, the options above are not mutually exclusive: for instance, an economic instrument can be legally \nbinding.  \n \n\n\u201cPolicy  cycle\u201d:  this  political  science  concept  is  widely  used  to  analyse  and  inform  public  policy-making \nprocesses, but can be transposed to any recurrent pattern leading to the implementation of a policy or \npolicy instrument. The following approach with regards to the various stages of the policy cycle is adopted:  \n\u2022  Policy development, including Agenda setting (e.g. the problem identified is high enough on the public \nagenda that action becomes likely) and Policy design (e.g. setting objectives, identifying costs-benefits \nof potential policy instruments and selecting);  \n\n\u2022  Policy adopted or officially launched (e.g. adopting or authorizing the preferred policy options through \n\nthe legislative process and refined through the bureaucratic process);  \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 14 February 2018 \n\n\u2022  Policy under implementation through specific actions (e.g. translating policy into concrete action and \n\npolicy instruments); results and impacts are being monitored; \n\n\u2022  Policy and related action plan has reached its end date and has been evaluated. \n \nComments and limitations: \nWhereas the indicator quantifies and monitors countries\u2019 progress along the policy cycle of binding and \nnon-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption and Production; it does not \nprovide any qualitative information and whether policies were well-designed or if a proper background \nanalysis had been conducted, the quality of implementation, level of enforcement, and its effects. These \naspects will have to be looked at through narrative reports / qualitative analysis.  \n \nThe indicator encompasses policy instruments supporting the shift to SCP, including: policies which \nidentify SCP as a key priority, policies focused on SCP and sectoral policies with SCP objectives. It is \nacknowledged that sectoral policies are also being reported under other SDG indicators and in particular \n12.7.1 (# of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans) and 12.b.1 \n(# of sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action plans with agreed monitoring and \nevaluation tools). \n \nEstablishing baselines and targets can be time and resource intensive and depends on the willingness of \n10YFP National Focal Points to communicate necessary information.  \n \nMain aspects regarding precision, reliability, attribution and double counting are addressed above.

However it does not cover the dark number of crime, i.e. the number of victims non detected \nby the authorities. While information on detected victims can provide valuable information to monitor \nsex and age profile of detected victims, as well as on forms of exploitation ,trafficking flows, the number \nof detected victims per se doesn\u2019t monitor the level of trafficking of persons so interpretation of trends \nshould be done with caution, as changes in detected victims of trafficking can be due to multiple factors \nsuch as intensity of trafficking flows but also to changes of law enforcement practices, changes in \nlegislation, or changes in victims attitudes,. \n \n"

Indicator 5.6.2 measures only the existence of laws and regulations; it does not measure \ntheir implementation.   \n \nConcepts: \nLaws: laws and statutes are official rules of conduct or action prescribed, or formally recognized as \nbinding, or enforced by a controlling authority that governs the behavior of actors (including people, \ncorporations, associations, government agencies).  They are adopted or ratified by the legislative branch \nof government and may be formally recognized in the Constitution or interpreted by courts.  Laws \ngoverning sexual and reproductive health are not necessarily contained in one law.  \n \nRegulations: are considered to be executive, ministerial or other administrative orders or decrees.   At the \nmunicipal level, regulations are sometimes called ordinances.  Regulations and ordinances issued by \ngovernmental entities have the force of law, although circumscribed by the level of the issuing authority.  \nUnder this methodology, only regulations with national-level application are considered.   \nRestrictions: many laws and regulations contain restrictions in the scope of their applicability.  Such \nrestrictions, which include, though are not limited to, those by age, sex, marital status, and requirement \nfor third party authorization, represent barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health \ncare, information and education.   \n \nPlural legal systems: are defined as legal systems in which multiple sources of law co-exist.  Such legal \nsystems have typically developed over a period of time as a consequence of colonial inheritance, religion \nand other socio-cultural factors.  Examples of sources of law that might co-exist under a plural legal \nsystem include: English common law, French civil or other law, statutory law, and customary and religious \nlaw.  The co-existence of multiple sources of law can create fundamental contradictions in the legal \nsystem, which result in barriers to full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, \ninformation and education.   \n \n\u201cGuarantee\u201d (access): for the purpose of this methodology, \u201cguarantee\u201d is understood in relation to a law \nor regulation that assures a particular outcome or condition.  The methodology recognizes that laws can \nonly guarantee \u201cin principle\u201d; for the outcomes to be fully realized in practice, additional steps, including \npolicy and budgetary measures will need to be in place. \n \n"

According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is \ndefined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is \ndefined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public \norganizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system \nof a country.  \n Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, \nintentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a \ncomplement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically \nprovided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as \nforms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and \nless structured than either formal or non-formal education.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nIn order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and global level, three sub-indicators are \nrecommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers \n(price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-\npricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement \non Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, \n1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations \nStatistical Office\u2019s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is \nproposed to drop the wording \u201cas a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels\u201d and thus this \nindicator is effectively \"Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)\". \n  \nRationale: \nThe scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving the \ngoals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their \npromotion through subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key goals, \nsuch as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, providing access to energy, and \naddressing climate change. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that poor households that are \nparticularly vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. Energy-dependent sectors of \nthe economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore \nrequires careful analysis and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel subsidies \nto sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to reaching the SDGs.  \n \nAwareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data is necessary to increase \ntransparency and inform decision-making. Reporting against a global indicator measuring consumer and \nproducer fossil fuel subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and producer \nsubsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and serve as an important guide for policy-\nmaking.  \n \nConcepts: \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2021 \n\nThe  concepts  and  definitions  used  in  the  methodology  have  been  based  on  existing  international \nframeworks and glossaries. \n\n\u2022  Use  definition  of  fossil  fuels  from  IEA  Statistics  Manual,  \u201cFossil  fuels  are  taken  from  natural \nresources which were formed from biomass in the geological past. By extension, the term fossil is \nalso applied to any secondary fuel manufactured from a fossil fuel.\u201d \n\n\u2022  Use the terms set out in CPC Rev. 2.1 for the statistical classification of the individual products.

Child \noverweight refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her height. This form of malnutrition results from \nexpending too few calories for the amount of food consumed and increases the risk of noncommunicable \ndiseases later in life. Child overweight is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators. \n \nConcepts: \nThe official MDG indicator is overweight as assessed using weight for height.

The number of Internet users has increased substantially over \nthe last decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and do \nbusiness.

Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage. \n\nIndirect economic loss: a decline in economic value added as a consequence of direct economic loss \n\nand/or human and environmental impacts. \n\nAnnotations:  \nExamples of physical assets that are the basis for calculating direct economic loss include homes, schools, \nhospitals, commercial and governmental buildings, transport, energy, telecommunications infrastructures and \nother infrastructure; business assets and industrial plants; production such as crops, livestock and production \ninfrastructure. They may also encompass environmental assets and cultural heritage.  Direct economic losses \nusually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after \nthe event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to \nmeasure. \n \nRationale and Interpretation: \nThe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March \n2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. Among the global targets, \u201cTarget C: Reduce direct disaster \neconomic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030\u201d will contribute to sustainable \ndevelopment and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience.

It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the \ngovernment budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national \ngovernments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries \nover time.  \n \nA low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors are investing in water and \nsanitation related activities and programmes in the country outside the purview of the national \ngovernment. A high value (near 100%) would indicate that donors are aligned with national government \nand national policies and plans for water and sanitation. \n \nConcepts: \n \n\u201cInternational cooperation and capacity-building support\u201d implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form \nof grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official \nDevelopment Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nSystem (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the \neconomic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are \nconcessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of \ndiscount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, \nto developing countries (\u201cbilateral ODA\u201d) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient \nperspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export \ncredit agencies\u2014with the pure purpose of export promotion\u2014is excluded (see \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). \n \n\u201cDeveloping countries\u201d refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance \n(see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries \nreceiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going \nforward. \n \nWater and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and \nhygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water \nresource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes \nactivities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, \nrecycling and reuse technologies.  \n \nA government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and \nsanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future \nneeds. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nData on water and sanitation-related ODA included in the government budget will be available by end-\n2016 with the current cycle of UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-\nWater (GLAAS) data. Until then, total water and sanitation-related ODA (denominator) will be reported. \nTotal water and sanitation-related ODA will continue to be reported as an additional indicator going \nforward. \n \nIn addition, the proportion of ODA channelled through the government treasury will be reported as an \nadditional indicator. ODA channelled through treasury indicates a high level of cooperation and \nalignment between donors and national government in which the donors channel funds through the \nnational budget process.  \n \nThe OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for the water and sanitation \namong several categories including: sector policy and administration, water resources protection, large \nand basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural water \nresources, and education and training. While these categories do not align directly with the target areas \nof SDG 6 individually, which limits the disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined \nODA from these categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water sector. \n \nAs the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is the possibility of different \nunderlying assumptions regarding what should be included/excluded in the ODA figures. This could lead \nto situations in which the proportion of ODA included in government budget is greater than 1 (100%) if \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\ntotal ODA reported to OECD is lower than ODA reported to be included the budget. To guard against this \npossibility, the OECD will supply GLAAS with the reported ODA figures, broken down to the project level, \nso that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data.  \n \nODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation. To capture other dimensions, additional \nsupporting indicators are available, including indicators for the Collaborative Behaviours identified by the \nSanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership. Each behaviour has one or two key indicators for \ngovernments and for development partners. If the behaviours are jointly adapted by governments and \ndevelopment partners, long-term sector performance and sustainability would improve.

Refers to all fixed -broadband Internet \nsubscriptions with advertised downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 10 Mbit/s. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe Internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to information, and can help \nfoster and enhance regional and international cooperation on, and access to, science, technology and \ninnovations, and enhance knowledge sharing. High-speed Internet access is important to ensure that \nInternet users have quality access to the Internet and can take advantage of the growing amount of \nInternet content \u2013 including user-generated content \u2013, services and information. \n \nWhile the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased substantially over the last years and \nwhile service providers offer increasingly higher speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously \nby speed, thus affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. Many countries, especially in the \ndeveloping world, have not only a very limited amount of fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very \nlow speeds. This limitation is a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator highlights the potential of the \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nInternet (especially through high-speed access) to enhance cooperation, improve access to science, \ntechnology and innovation, and share knowledge. The indicator also highlights the importance of Internet \nuse as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, \nwill aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Information on fixed broadband subscriptions by \nspeed will contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides. \n \nConcepts: \n \nFixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet \n(a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable \nmodem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite \nbroadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of \npayment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via \nmobile-cellular networks.

Countries may use packages that do not align with the speeds used for this \ngroup of indicators. Countries are encouraged to collect the data in more speed categories so as to allow \naggregation of the data according to the split shown above.

The share of the population living below 50% of \nmedian national income is a measure that is useful for monitoring the level and trends in social inclusion, \nrelative poverty and inequality within a country.  \n \nThe share of people living below 50% of the median is an indicator of relative poverty and inequality of \nthe income distribution within a country. This indicator and similar relative measures are commonly used \nfor poverty measurement in rich countries (including Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment\u2019s (OECD) poverty indicators and Eurostat\u2019s indicators of risk of poverty or social exclusion) \nand are increasingly also used as a complementary measure of inequality and poverty in low- and middle- \nincome countries.  \n \nConcepts: \nThe indicator is measured using per capita welfare measure of consumption or income. The indicator is \ncalculated by estimating the share of the population in a country living on less than 50% of median of the \nnational distribution of income or consumption, as estimated from survey data.  \n \nPer capita income or consumption is estimated using total household income or consumption divided by \nthe total household size. Total disposable income or total consumption from both market and non-\nmarket sources is the desired welfare vector used.  \n \nThe estimation relies on on the same harmonized welfare vectors (distributions) that are used for 10.1.1 \nand 1.1.1. Using the same data and closely related methodologies ensures internal consistency across \nthese closely related indicators. The data is available through PovcalNet, the World Bank\u2019s online tool for \nreporting global poverty and inequality numbers. For details on concepts and standards, refer to \ndocumentation available on the PovcalNet website.  \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: November 2018 \n\n \nThe methodology entails measuring the share of people living below 50% of national median. A threshold \nset at 50% of the median of the income or consumption is used to derive a headcount rate, similar to \nhow monetary poverty is typically measured. The national median is readily available from the \ndistributional data in PovcalNet. The measurement follows a two-step process of first estimating half of \nthe national median income (or consumption) and then the share of people living below this relative \nthreshold. \n \nThe indicator uses the same data on household income and consumption that is used for monitoring SDG \nindicators 1.1.1 and 10.1.1, which have been classified as Tier 1 indicators. The methodology and data are \nsimilar to that used in measuring international poverty, which has been tested and vetted over many \nyears, including for the purpose of monitoring MDG 1. It is also closely related to a large literature of \nrelative poverty measurement.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nLike for poverty rates (SDG 1.1.1) and growth in household incomes across the distribution (SDG 10.1.1), \nestimates are based on income or consumption data collected in household surveys, led by NSOs. Many \nof the same data quality issues applying to those indicators apply here, some of which are summarized \nbelow: \n \nData is collected with great heterogeneity and ex-post harmonization will always face limitations. Similar \nsurveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing, sampling frames, or the quality \nand training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose \nproblems because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The \nlocal market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in \nunderdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure, but in practice \nare often not. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, \nbut valuation methods vary.  \n \nEstimating the share of people living below 50% of the national median is less sensitive to comparability \nlimitations than estimates of international poverty. The relative nature of the threshold (a function of the \ndistribution median) means that it is not sensitive price differences across time and countries. \nAppropriately adjusting for price differences is a major challenger in absolute poverty measurement.  \n \n"

International human rights law refers to the body of international legal \ninstruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations. \n \nRationale: \nThe pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the centre of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development. The elimination of discrimination is also enshrined in the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights and the core international human rights treaties. The purpose of this indicator is to \nmeasure a prevalence of discrimination based on the personal experience reported by individuals.  It is \nconsidered an outcome indicator (see HR/PUB/12/5) helping to measure the effectiveness of non-\ndiscriminatory laws, policy and practices for the concerned population groups. \n \nConcepts: \nDiscrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that \nis directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or \neffect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public \nlife.1  Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of \ndiscrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, \nabuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, \n                                                           \n1 See, for instance, Art. 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination (ICERD); Art. 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \nWomen (CEDAW); Art. 2 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD); General \nComment 18 of the Human Rights Committee (paragraphs 6 and 7) and General Comment 20 of the \nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (paragraph 7). \n\n hostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take \nthe form of a single incident.2 \n\n \n\nInternational human rights law provides lists of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The inclusion of \n\u201cother status\u201d in these lists indicate that they are not exhaustive and that other grounds may be \nrecognized by international human rights mechanisms. A review of the international human rights \nnormative framework helps identify a list of grounds that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, \npolitical or other opinion, national origin, social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, \nmarital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic \nand social situation, pregnancy, indigenous status, afro-descent and other status.3 In practice, it will be \ndifficult to include all potentially relevant grounds of discrimination in household survey questions. For \nthis reason, it is recommended that data collectors identify contextually relevant and feasible lists of \ngrounds, drawing on the illustrative list and formulation of prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined \nin the methodology section below, and add an \u201cother\u201d category to reflect other grounds that may not \nhave been listed explicitly. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nThe indicator measures an overall population prevalence of discrimination and harassment in the total \npopulation at the national level. The indicator will not necessarily inform on the prevalence of \ndiscrimination within specific population groups. This will depend on sample frames. For example, if \ndisability is included within the selected grounds, the resulting data for discrimination on the ground of \ndisability will represent only the proportion of the total population who feel that they had personally \nexperienced discrimination against on the ground of disability. Unless the sample design provides \nadequate coverage of people with disability to allow disaggregation on this characteristic, the data \ncannot be understood as an indication of the prevalence of discrimination (on the ground of disability) \nwithin the population of people with a disability. \n \nThe indicator is not measuring a general perception of respondents on the overall prevalence of \ndiscrimination in a country.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThe indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water \nquality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and \nrepresents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. \nThe indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples \ncollected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical \nparameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with \nmajor impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically \nunfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. \nTherefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for \nthe assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6.3.2. The quality \nstatus  of  individual  water  bodies  is  classified  based  on  the  compliance  of  the  available  water  quality monitoring  data  for  the  core  parameters  with  target  values  defined  by  the  country.  The  indicator  is \ncomputed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at \nleast 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage.  \n \nConcepts: \nThe  concepts  and  definitions  used  in  the  methodology  have  been  based  on  existing  international \nframeworks and glossaries (WMO 2012) unless where indicated otherwise below. \n \nAquifer: Geological formation capable of storing, transmitting and yielding exploitable quantities of \nwater.  \n\nClassification of water quality: If at least 80% of the monitoring values for prescribed parameters in a \nwater body comply with their respective target values, the water body is classified as having a \u201cgood\u201d \nwater quality status. Each water body is classified as being of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cnot good\u201d status.  \n\nGroundwater: Subsurface water occupying the saturated zone.  \n\nGroundwater  body:  A  distinct  volume  of  groundwater  within  an  aquifer  or  aquifers  (EU  2000). \nGroundwater bodies that cross river basin district (RBD) boundaries should be divided at the boundary with \neach separate portion of the groundwater body being reported separately along with its respective RBD.  \n\nLake: Inland body of standing surface water of significant extent.  \n\nNon-point-source pollution: Pollution of water bodies from dispersed sources such as fertilizers, \nchemicals and pesticides used in agricultural activities. \n\nParameter: Water quality variable or characteristic of water quality, also called a determinand. \n\nPoint source pollution: Pollution with a precisely located origin. \n\nPollution (of water): Introduction into water of any undesirable substance which renders the water unfit \nfor its intended use. \n\nPollutant: Substance which disrupts and interferes with the equilibrium of a water system and impairs \nthe suitability of using the water for a desired purpose.  \n\nReservoir: Body of water, either natural or man-made, used for storage, regulation and control of water \nresources. \n\nRiver: Large stream which serves as the natural drainage for a basin. \n\nRiver basin: Geographical area having a common outlet for its surface runoff. \n\nRiver basin district:  Area of land, made up of one or more neighbouring river basins together with their \nassociated groundwaters (EU, 2000). \n\nRiver water body: A coherent section of a river that is discrete (does not overlap with another water \nbody) and is significant rather than arbitrarily designated.  \n\nStream: Flowing body of water in a natural surface channel. Surface water: Water which flows over, or lies on, the ground surface. Note: Indicator 6.3.2 does not \ninclude the monitoring of water quality in wetlands under monitoring level 1. \n\nTarget value:  A value (or range) for any given water quality parameter that indicates the threshold for a \ndesignated water quality, such as good water quality rather than acceptable water quality. \n\nToxic substance: Chemical substance which can disturb the physiological functions of humans, animals \nand plants. \n\nTransboundary waters: Surface or ground waters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries \nbetween two or more States; wherever transboundary waters flow directly into the sea, these \ntransboundary waters end at a straight line across their respective mouths between points on the low-\nwater line of the banks (UNECE, 1992). \n \nWater quality index: The measured water quality results for all parameters combined into a numeric \nvalue for each monitoring location. These scores are then aggregated over the time of the assessment \nperiod. The index score can range between zero (worst) to 100 (best). \n \n"

These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions \u201c3. Unpaid domestic services \nfor household and family members\u201d and \u201c4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family \nmembers\u201d. \n \nAs much as possible, statistics compiled by UNSD are based on the International Classification of \nActivities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016), which classifies activities undertaken by persons \nduring the survey period. ICATUS 2016 was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission for use \nas an international statistical classification at its 48th session, 7-10 March 2017. \n \nComments and limitations: \nTime use statistics have been used for: (1) provide a measure of quality of life or general wellbeing of \nindividuals and households; (2) offer a more comprehensive measurement of all forms of work, including \nunpaid household service work; (3) produce data relevant for monitoring gender equality and the \nempowerment of women and girls and are essential inputs for the policy and political dialogue on gender \nequality. \n \nInternational comparability of time-use statistics is limited by a number of factors, including:  \n\na)  Diary versus stylized time-use survey. Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary \n(light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what \nactivity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time \nthat activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use \nquestions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a \nspecified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a \nmodule to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than \nthe stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these \ntwo different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with \ndifferent stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about \nactivities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time \nspent on a given activity.   \n\nb)  Time-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may \n\ndiffer from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries.  c)  Time-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed \n\nsimultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a \nwoman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking \nas the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the \nstatistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it \nmay also underestimate the time women spend on this activity.  \n\nd)  Different target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data \n\ndifficult to compare across countries. \n\n \n"

These foundations have been established in the ILO\u2019s Constitution (1919), the ILO Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), in two key ILO Conventions (namely the \nFreedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right \nto Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98)) and the ILO Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998). They are also rights proclaimed in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948) and other international and regional human rights instruments. With \nthe adoption of the 1998 ILO Declaration, the promotion and realization of these fundamental principles \nand rights also became a constitutional obligation of all ILO member States. \n \nFACB rights are considered as \u2018enabling rights\u2019, the realisation of which is necessary to promote and \nrealise other rights at work. They provide an essential foundation for social dialogue, effective labour \nmarket governance and realization of decent work. They are vital in enabling employers and workers to \nassociate and efficiently negotiate work relations, to ensure that both employers and workers have an \nequal voice in negotiations, and that the outcome is fair and equitable. As such they play a crucial role in \nthe elaboration of economic and social policies that take on board the interests and needs of all actors in \nthe economy. FACB rights are also salient because they are indispensable pillars of democracy as well as \nthe process of democratization. \n \nFACB rights, together with other international labour standards, are backed by the ILO\u2019s unique \nsupervisory system. The ILO regularly examines the application of standards in member States and \nhighlights areas where those standards are violated and where they could be better applied. The ILO\u2019s \nsupervisory system includes two kinds of supervisory mechanisms: the regular system of supervision and \nthe special procedures. The prior entails the examination of periodic reports submitted by member States \non the measures taken to implement the provisions of ILO Conventions ratified by them. The special \nprocedures, that is, representations, complaints and the special procedure for complaints regarding \nfreedom of association through the Freedom of Association Committee, allow for the examination of \nviolations on the basis of a submission of a representation or a complaint.  \n \n"

Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances \nof illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable.

Primary education offers \nlearning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, \nwriting and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of \nknowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if \nany, specialisation.  \n \nThe official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education \naccording to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in \ndifferent parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in \nthe country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level. \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \n \nThis indicator measures the volumes of wastewater which are generated through different activities, and \nthe volumes of wastewater which are safely treated before discharge into the environment. Both of \nthese indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units \nthat require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the \n\u2018proportion of wastewater flow safely treated\u2019.  \n \nWastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the  \nInternational Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent \npossible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the \nenvironment will be calculated. \n \nRationale: \nWastewater data are crucial to promote strategies for sustainable and safe wastewater use or reuse \nto the benefit of the world\u2019s population health and the global environment, but also to respond to \ngrowing water demands, increasing water pollution loads, and climate change impacts on water \nresources. \n \nSustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is about ensuring the availability and sustainability of water \nand sanitation for all by 2030. SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water quality, which is \nessential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, minimizing and \nsignificantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies. \n \nThe purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely \ninformation to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress \ntowards reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and increasing \nwastewater treatment and reuse. The target wording covers wastewater recycling and safe reuse \nwith implication on water use efficiency, although it is not fully addressed by the global indicator and \nmethodology.  \nSDG indicator 6.3.1 tracks the proportion of wastewater flows from households, services and \nindustrial economic activities that are safely treated at the source or through centralized wastewater \ntreatment plants before being discharged into the environment, out of the total volume of \nwastewater generated. \n \nConcepts: \nTotal wastewater generation and treatment can be quantified at the national level, and wastewater can \nalso be disaggregated into different types of flows, based on ISIC categories. Domestic wastewater \ngenerated by private households, as well as wastewater generated by economic activities covered by ISIC \ncategories, may or may not be pre-treated on premises before discharge to either the sewer for further \ntreatment or directly to the environment, as shown in Figure 1. \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Schematic Representation of wastewater sources, collecting systems and treatment \n(modified from wastewater loading diagram, OECD/Eurostat 2018). \n \n \nThe main sources of wastewater include wastewater from households, services and industries, i.e. point \nsources of one or more pollutant(s) that can be geographically located and represented as a point on a \nmap. Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can \ncontribute quite significantly to wastewater flows (Figure 1), and therefore its progressive inclusion in the \nglobal monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its \nimpact on ambient water quality will be monitored under indicator 6.3.2 \u201cProportion of bodies of water \nwith good ambient water quality\u201d.  \n \nDifferentiating between the different wastewater streams is important as policy decisions need to be \nguided by the polluter pays principle. However, wastewater conveyed by combined sewers usually \ncombines both hazardous and non-hazardous substances discharged from different sources, but also \nrunoff and urban stormwater, which cannot be separately tracked and monitored. As a consequence, \nalthough the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services industrial), the treated  wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and \nindustrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources. \n \nTotal wastewater flows can be classified into three main categories (see \u2018disaggregation section\u2019 for \ndetails: \n\u2022 \nIndustrial (ISIC divisions 05-35) \n\u2022 \nServices (ISIC divisions 45-96) \n\u2022  Domestic (private households) \n\n \nWastewater treatment can be classified into three main categories (see \u2018disaggregation section\u2019 for \ndetails: \n\n\u2022  Primary \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Tertiary \n\nSecondary \n\n \nWhere possible, treatment will additionally be classified into either on-premises or off-premises \ntreatment.  \n \nDomestic wastewater: Wastewater from residential settlements which originates predominantly \nfrom the human metabolism and from household activities. \n\nIndustrial (process) wastewater: Water discharged after being used in, or produced by, industrial \nproduction processes and which is of no further immediate value to these processes. Where process \nwater recycling systems have been installed, process wastewater is the final discharge from these \ncircuits. To meet quality standards for eventual discharge into public sewers, this process waste-\nwater is understood to be subjected to ex-process in-plant treatment. Cooling water is not \nconsidered here. Sanitary wastewater and surface runoff from industries are also excluded here. \n\nTotal wastewater generated is the total volume of wastewater generated by economic activities \n(agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air \nconditioning supply; and other economic activities) and households. Cooling water is excluded.  \n\nUrban wastewater: Domestic wastewater or the mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial \nwastewater and/or runoff rain water.  \n\nWastewater: Wastewater is water which is of no further value to the purpose for which it was used \nbecause of its quality, quantity or time of occurrence. Cooling water is not considered here. \n\nWastewater discharge: The amount of water (in m3) or substance (in kg BOD/d or comparable) \nadded/leached to a water body (Fresh or non-fresh) from a point source. \n\nWastewater treatment: Process to render wastewater fit to meet applicable environmental \nstandards or other quality norms for recycling or reuse. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \n There is a relative lack of knowledge about the volumes of wastewater generated and treated, \nbecause wastewater statistics are in an early stage of development in many countries and not \nregularly produced or reported. Monitoring is relatively complex, costly, and data are not \nsystematically aggregated to the national level and/or accessible; especially industrial wastewater \ndata which are in general poorly monitored and seldom aggregated at national level. \n \nTo some extent, this may be explained by the fact that a large proportion of the industrial water \nrequirements are covered by the use of private systems using non-public/drinking water supply \n(groundwater, rivers and wells) which are not systematically included in the national statistics. \n \nDiffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can \ncontribute significantly to wastewater flows, and therefore its progressive inclusion in the global \nmonitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its impact \non ambient water quality will be monitored indirectly under indicator 6.3.2 on the proportion of \nbodies of water with good ambient water quality. \n \nDifferent types of wastewater have different degrees of contamination and pose different levels of \nthreat to the environment and public health. Some data exist on the pollutant loading in terms of \nBOD5 and COD (kg O2/day), but these are not as widely available as data on volumes and will not be \nused at present for indicator 6.3.1. It is anticipated that future data drives will include more \ninformation on pollutant loadings that could be eventually featured in SDG 6.3.1 reporting.  \n \nFinally, whether wastewater is classified as safely treated or not depends on the wastewater treatment \nplant\u2019s compliance rate to the effluent standards (i.e. performance). Many wastewater plants produce \neffluent which does not meet quality standards, due to improper design or loading. Effluent standards \nrely on both national and local requirements, as well as on specific water uses and potential reuse \noptions, so that this approach may not provide strictly comparable variables between countries. For the \npurposes of global monitoring, in the absence of data on compliance, technology-based proxies will be \nused, in which compliance is assumed if the treatment plant provides at least secondary treatment.  \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \nProportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or \nestablished by a competent authority in line with international instruments \n \nRationale: \nWhile Target 16.4 aims at significantly reducing illicit arms flows, directly measuring these types of flows \nis extremely difficult due to the underground nature of illicit arms trafficking. Therefore, the indicator \ndoes not aim at measuring these flows, but the efficiency with which the international community \ncombats the phenomenon of illicit arms trafficking.   \n \nConcepts: \nArms: arms refer to \u2018small arms and light weapons\u2019, defined as any portable lethal weapon that expels or \nlaunches, is designed to expel or launch, or may be readily converted to expel or launch a shot, bullet or \nprojectile by the action of an explosive, excluding antique small arms and light weapons or their replicas. \nAntique small arms and light weapons and their replicas will be defined in accordance with domestic law, \nand in no case will they include those manufactured after 1899. Arms include all firearms, as defined in \nthe \u201cProtocol against the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components \nand ammunition\u201d.  \nIn particular, \u2018small arms\u2019 are, broadly speaking, weapons for individual use, including revolvers, pistols, \nrifles and carbines, shotguns, sub-machine guns and light machine guns. \u2018Light weapons\u2019 are, broadly \nspeaking, weapons designed for use by two or three persons serving as a crew, although some may be \ncarried and used by a single person. They include, heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and \nmounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, \nportable launchers of anti-tank missile and rocket systems, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile \nsystems, and mortars of a calibre of less than 100 millimetres. \nSeized: arms that have been physically apprehended during the reported period by a competent \nauthority, whether temporarily or not, in relation to a suspected criminal offence or administrative \nviolation related to these arms. For the purpose of the calculation of indicator 16.4.2, only arms that \nwere seized due to criminal offences are considered. Found: arms apprehended by authorities that are not linked to an intentional or planned investigation or \ninspection, neither attributable to any apparent holder or owner, regardless of whether the items were \nreported lost or stolen.  \nSurrendered: arms willingly handed over to authorities that are not linked to a planned investigation or \ninspection. The surrender may occur as a personal initiative of a citizen in the context of a voluntary \nsurrender campaign and disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, inter alia. \nIllicit origin: Earliest point in time in the life of an arm where it was of an illicit nature. In order to \nestablish the illicit origin, it is necessary to identify the point of diversion of the arm and the \ncircumstances around it. \nPoint of diversion: the point in space and time and/or circumstances when arms left the licit circuit and \nentered the illicit one. If identified through tracing, the last legal record needs to be found. For arms \nillicitly manufactured, the point of diversion is the manufacture itself.  \nLast legal record: last recorded information available about the item, its status (deactivated, stolen, lost, \nseized, found, surrendered, sent for destruction, confiscated, in transit, etc.) and its legal end-user.  The \nidentification of the last legal record may require the initiation of several individual tracing requests. \nTracing: the systematic tracking of weapons and, where possible, their parts and components, and \nammunition, at the national and/or international level for the purpose of assisting the competent \nauthorities of States parties in detecting, investigating and analysing illicit manufacturing and illicit \ntrafficking. \nIllicit origin established by a competent authority in line with international instruments: illicit origin \nestablished through means other than tracing, e.g. through intelligence. In the case of arms that are not \ntraceable, this is the only mean to establishing the illicit origin.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nThere are certain limitations to the methodology used in the calculation of indicator 16.4.2: \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nThe pilot study and consultations with Member States revealed that countries could not properly \nprovide information on the circumstances of illicit manufacture or altered / erased markings for \narms nor uniquely identifiable. Therefore, information on the establishment of the illicit origin \nfor these arms is not available. \nThe values for indicator 16.4.2 may be affected by whether the country has a significant \nproportion of apprehended arms that are traceable, which is usually a consequence of the \ncontext of illicit arms trafficking in the country and is not related to its Law Enforcement efforts. \nThe process of tracing firearms can be notably long, especially if several requests are involved. \nTherefore, the information on tracing results provided on the questionnaire for the reference \nyear may be incomplete. While the fact that countries are requested to review the figures \nreported during the previous data collection cycle may partially correct for this, there may still be \na bias in the calculation. \n\nIn addition to indicator 16.4.2 as defined in this document, other non-official indicators may be of \nassistance when interpreting the reporting values. In particular, information is collected on the number \nof international tracing requests placed and responded to, and the total number of arms seized, found \nand surrendered by whether they are uniquely marked or not, the total number of arms that have been \nmarked, recorded or destroyed. In addition, data on the number of individuals in contact with the police, \nprosecuted and convicted, in relation to illicit trafficking of arms is available. All these indicators could \nhelp complete the picture regarding the extent of Law Enforcement activities at the national level to \ncounter illicit trafficking in arms. \n    "

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThe Indicator measures the total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows (IFFs) in current United \nStates dollars. IFFs are defined as \u201cfinancial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an \nexchange of value and that cross country borders\u201d. \n \n \nRationale: \nA major challenge to sustainable development of societies around the world, particularly in developing \ncountries, is represented by several criminal activities and tax-related illicit practices which are at the \norigin or associated with IFFs. Proceeds from criminal activities are often transferred between countries \nto be laundered, utilized and reinvested in licit or illicit activities. These flows drain resources from \nsustainable development. Combatting IFFs is therefore a crucial component of the goal to promote \npeace, justice and strong institutions, as set out in Goal 16 of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment. \n \nConcepts: \n \nIFFs are defined as \u201cfinancial flows that are illicit in origin, transfer or use, that reflect an exchange of \nvalue and that cross country borders\u201d. \n \nThus, IFFs have the following features:  \n\n\u25cf \n\nIllicit in origin, transfer or use. A flow of value is considered illicit if it is illicitly generated (e.g. \noriginates  from  criminal  activities  or  tax  evasion),  illicitly  transferred  (e.g.  violating  currency \ncontrols)  or  illicitly  used  (e.g.  for  financing  terrorism).  The  flow  can  be  legally  generated, \ntransferred or used, but it must be illicit in at least one of these aspects. Some flows that are not \nstrictly illegal may fall within the statistical definition of IFFs, e.g. cross-border tax avoidance which \nerodes the tax base of a country where that income was generated.  \n\n\u25cf  Exchange of value, rather than purely financial transfers. Exchange of value includes exchange of \ngoods  and  services,  and  financial  and  non-financial  assets.  For  instance,  illicit  cross-border \n\n \n\n1 bartering,  meaning  the  illicit  exchange  of  goods  and  services  for  other  goods  and  services,  is  a \ncommon practice in illegal markets and it is considered as IFF. \n\n\u25cf \n\nIFFs measure a flow of value over a given time - as opposed to a stock measure, which would be \nthe accumulation of value.  \n\n\u25cf  Flows that cross a border.1 This includes assets that cross borders and assets where the ownership \nchanges  from  a  resident  of a  country  to  a  non-resident,  even if  the  assets  remain in  the  same \njurisdiction.  \n\n \nIFFs refer to activities that are considered as criminal offences and to a series of behaviours in the area of \nillicit tax and commercial practices. The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) \nprovides definitions of relevant offences. \n \nThere are four main types of activities that can generate IFFs: \n\n\u25cf \n\nIllicit  tax  and  commercial  IFFs:  These  include  illicit  practices  by  legal  entities  as  well  as \narrangements  and  individuals  with  the  objective  of  concealing  revenues  and  reducing  tax \nburden  through  evading  controls  and  regulations.  This  category  can  be  divided  into  two \ncomponents:  \n\no \n\no \n\nIllegal tax and commercial IFFs. These include illegal practices such as tariff, duty and \nrevenue  offences,  tax  evasion,  competition  offences  and  market  manipulation \namongst others, as included in the ICCS. Most of these activities are non-observed, \nhidden or part of the shadow, underground or informal economy that may generate \nIFFs.  \n\nIFFs  from  aggressive  tax  avoidance.  Illicit  flows  can  also  be  generated  from  legal \neconomic activities through aggressive tax avoidance. This can take place through the \nmanipulation of transfer pricing, strategic location of debt and intellectual property, \ntax treaty shopping and the use of hybrid instruments and entities. These flows need \nto be carefully considered, as they generally arise from legal business transactions and \nonly the illicit part of the cross-border flows belongs within the scope of IFFs. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIFFs from corruption: The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) defines \nacts considered as corruption, and they are consistently defined in the ICCS, such as bribery, \nembezzlement, abuse of functions, trading in influence, illicit enrichment and other acts of \ncorruption in the scope. When these acts \u2013 directly or indirectly - generate cross-border \nflows, they generate IFFs.  \n\n\u2022  Exploitation-type activities, and financing of crime and terrorism: Exploitation-type activities \nare non-productive activities that entail a forced, involuntary and illicit transfer of economic \nresources between two actors. Terrorism financing and financing of crime are illicit, \nvoluntary transfers of funds between two actors. Examples of exploitation-type activities are \nsexual exploitation, theft, extortion, illicit enrichment, and kidnapping. When the related \nfinancial flows cross country borders, they constitute IFFs. \n\n                                                           \n1 The proposed bottom-up measurement approach described below considers domestic IFFs as part of the illegal economy \ntoo.  These  flows  would  not  fall  under  the  definition  of  IFFs  for  SDG  16.4.1,  but  are  of  high  relevance  to  understanding \norganised cross-border illicit flows.  \n\n \n\n2 \u25cf \n\nIFFs from illegal markets: These include trade in illicit goods and services when the corresponding \nfinancial flows cross borders. The focus is on criminal activities where income is generated through \nexchange (trade) of illegal goods or  services. Such processes often involve a degree of criminal \norganisation aimed at creating profit. They include any type of trafficking in goods, such as drugs \nand firearms, or services, such as smuggling of migrants. IFFs emerge from transnational trade in \nillicit goods and services, as well as from cross-border flows from managing the illicit income from \nsuch activities. \n\n \nThe UNODC (2015) International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) provides definitions \nof a number of behaviours, events and activities which may generate IFFs such as exploitation-type \nactivities and terrorism, trafficking activities and corruption, as well as many activities related to illicit tax-\nrelated and commercial practices.2 \n \nA number of criminal offences are identified as potentially generating IFFs.

A \ntransaction constitutes an IFFs when it crosses country borders. \nIllegal markets comprise all transactions related to the production and the trade with a \ncertain illicit good or service. Regardless of the illicit nature, these market activities are \nconsidered as being economically productive, because value added is generated at each \ntransaction. The value added describes the net increase in value (price times quantity) of the \nproduct at each transaction. \n\n \nBottom-up and direct measurement  \nA bottom-up and direct measurement approach is proposed for constructing the Indicator. Bottom-up \nmethods estimate IFFs directly in relation to the four main activities and build them up departing from \nthe overall economic income that illicit activities generate.  \n \nDirect refers to the fact that data referring to the various stages of the economic processes generating \nIFFs are individually measured (via surveys, administrative data or other transparent methods) and are \nnot the exclusive result of model-based procedures. The measurement approach is in line with the \n\u201cEurostat Handbook on the compilation of statistics on illegal economic activities in national accounts \nand balance of payments\u201d3 for the estimation of the contribution of illegal activities to the GDP. 4 \n \nDisaggregation \nSimilar to Eurostat\u2019s recommendations on measuring illegal economic activities, a disaggregated \nmeasurement approach is proposed that measures each relevant IFF type \u2013 respectively from illicit tax \nand commercial practices, from corruption, from exploitation-type and financing of crime and terrorism, \nand from illegal markets - in a separate manner.  \n \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe statistical definition of IFFs aims to provide a comprehensive definition of the phenomenon to be \nmeasured. It does not focus on a specific measurement approach (e.g., IFFs being measured through \ndiscrepancies in trade statistics between countries).  \n \nThe disaggregated and bottom-up measurement approach is in line with existing frameworks such as the \nSystem of National Accounts and the Balance of Payments and it follows international efforts to measure \nnon-observed or illegal economic activities.  \n\n                                                           \n3\n\n Available \n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/8714610/KS-05-17-202-EN-\n\nhere: \nN.pdf/eaf638df-17dc-47a1-9ab7-fe68476100ec \n4 With one principle difference. The mere transfer of funds (exploitation-type activities and terrorism financing) \nare not considered in the GDP estimates, as they are not productive transactions and may not be carried out \nwith the mutual agreement of both parties. Such activities can, however, generate noteworthy amounts of illicit \nincome  and  subsequent  IFFs.  The  present  framework  includes  activities  that  are  not  considered  as  being \nproductive in the framework of the System of National Accounts. \n\n \n\n4  \n \nSDG Indicator 16.4.1 calls for the measurement of the \u201ctotal value\u201d of inward and outward IFFs. While \nthis is useful as an indication of the overall size of the problem and for measuring progress, a more \ngranular measurement of IFFs helps to identify the main sources and channels of IFFs and can guide \ninterventions targeting IFFs.  \n \nCountries are affected by different types of IFFs and it is suggested that main types of IFFs are defined at \ncountry level. This limits the possibility of measuring all types of IFFs in a comprehensive manner and \ncomparability may be affected by different coverage from one country to another. However, the goal is \nto capture the most significant flows at country level and a gradual process of improving the \nexhaustiveness of the Indicator is expected, following the model of measuring illegal economic activities \nand the non-observed economy in the balance of payments and national accounts. \n \nThere is a risk of double-counting when adding together explicit estimates of activities generating IFFs. \nEstimates for IFFs should not be simply added together, because they may already include parts of others \n(e.g., drug trafficking and bribery) and there may be double-counting. During the expert consultations, \ndouble counting was discussed and will be addressed in guidelines issued to member states.  \n \n"

PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that \nallows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.20 a day global, regional and \ncountry-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for \ndifferent poverty lines.  \n \nThe Poverty and Equity Data portal provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with \ngraphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different \nregions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national \npoverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent with \nPovcalNet. \n \nConcepts: \n \nIn assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a \npoverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about \u201cglobal poverty?\u201d Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a \nstrong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining \npoverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat \ntwo people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way\u2014both are either poor or \nnot poor\u2014even if they live in different countries. \n \nSince World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in \nmeasuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The \nwelfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for \ndifferences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in \n1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development \nReport 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As \ndifferences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be \nperiodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October \n2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to \nthat, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures \nbased on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across \ncountries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank\u2019s World \nDevelopment Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency \nto equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 \nconsumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank\u2019s International Comparison Program (ICP). \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nFive countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Laos \u2013 use the 2005 PPP conversion \nfactors and corresponding $1.25 a day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in \nthe rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic consumer price indexes. See \nBox 1.1 in the Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016 (http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-\nmonitoring-report) for a detailed explanation. \n \nDespite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, \nfrequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in \nthe poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, \ncountries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The \nlow frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over \nthe magnitude of poverty reduction.  \n \nBesides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring \nhousehold living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was \nspent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to \nmeasure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can \nvary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest \nestimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries. \n \nHowever, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the \nquality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also \npose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, \nparticularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption \nexpenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from \nown production, but valuation methods vary. \n \n"

See here for full definition: https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104      \n\nIntimate partner violence against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner \nwithin the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. \n\nThe different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows:  \n\n1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited \nto, acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling  hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a fist \nor object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with \nsome sort of weapon, gun or knife.  \n\n2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on \nsomeone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual \ncontact, forced      sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or \nattempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In \nintimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally  defined in surveys as: being \nphysically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner \nmight do or through coercion, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers \nhumiliating or degrading. \n\n3. Psychological violence consists of any act       that induces fear or emotional distress     . It includes a \nrange of behaviors that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, \nintimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and \nsexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., \nbeing kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also \nconsidered acts of psychological abuse       For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see \nGuidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014), and the \nInternational Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes ICCS (UNODC, 2015), and Violence against \nWomen Prevalence Estimates, 2018.

The countries that have not used the methodology to date \nare primarily highly developed countries which would have less difficulty in providing the necessary data \nthan those in the lower and middle income categories that have been primary users of Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability (PEFA) to date. \n \nOne limitation of the indicator is that it is an aggregate indicator of budget reliability. While it can be \ndisaggregated across regions, it is not disaggregated across various budget subcomponents. Different \nindicators are used for assessing changes in expenditure composition in the PEFA framework. Also, while \nthis indicator is intended to measure budget reliability it should be understood that actual expenditure \noutturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of \nforecasts\u2014for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. However, the calibration of this \nindicator accommodates one unusual or \u201coutlier\u201d year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which \noccur in two of the three years covered by the assessment. Therefore, single year shocks are discounted \nallowing a more balanced assessment. \n \nThe broader context in which the indicator was developed is as follows. PEFA is a tool for assessing the \nstatus of public financial management and reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of Public Financial \nManagement (PFM). A PEFA assessment provides a thorough, consistent and evidence-based analysis of \nPFM performance at a specific point in time and can be reapplied in successive assessments to track \nchanges over time. The PEFA framework provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of \ncountries\u2019 PFM systems using 31 performance indicators that are further disaggregated into 94 \ndimensions. A PEFA assessment measures the extent to which PFM systems, processes and institutions \ncontribute to the achievement of desirable budget outcomes: aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic \nallocation of resources, and efficient service delivery. \n \n"

Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times \nc.

The  accessibility  based  urban  mobility  paradigm  also  critically  needs  good, \nhigh-capacity public transport systems that are well integrated in a multimodal arrangement with public \ntransport access points located within comfortable walking or cycling distances from homes and jobs for \nall.  \n \nThe ability of residents including persons with disabilities and businesses to access markets, employment \nopportunities, and service centers such as schools and hospitals is critical to urban economic development. \nThe transport system provides access to resources and employment opportunity. Moreover, accessibility \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: Feb 2021 \n\nallows planners to measure the effects of changes in transport and land use systems. The accessibility of \njobs,  services  and  markets  also  allow  policymakers,  citizens  and  businesses  to  discuss  the  state  of  the \ntransport  system  in  a  comprehensible  way. The  transportation  system  is  a  critical  enabler  of  economic \nactivities and social inclusion. The access to transport SDG indicator addresses a significant gap that was \nnever addressed by the MDGs, i.e. directly addressing transport as a critical enabler of economic activities \nand social inclusion. Already, the \u201cexternalities\u201d associated with transport in terms of Green House Gas \nEmissions, traffic congestion and road traffic accidents have been increasing. Emissions from transport are \nnow responsible for 23% of global Green House Gas Emissions and are increasing faster than any other \nsource;  outdoor  air  pollution  alone,  a  major  source  of  which  is  transport,  is  responsible  for  3.7  million \ndeaths  annually,  road  traffic  accidents  kill  more  than  1.2  million  people  every  year  and  severe  traffic \ncongestion is choking cities and impacting on GDPs. Achieving SDG 11 requires a fundamental shift in the \nthinking on transport- with the focus on the goal of transport rather than on its means. With accessibility \nto  services, goods  and  opportunities  for  all  as  the  ultimate  goal,  priority  is  given to  making  cities  more \ncompact and walkable through better planning and the integration of land-use planning with transport \nplanning.  The  means  of  transport  are  also  important  but  the  SDG\u2019s  imperative  to  make  the  city  more \ninclusive means that cities will have to move away from car-based travel to public transport and active \nmodes of transport such as walking and cycling with good inter-modal connectivity.  \n \nThe rising traffic congestion levels and the resulting negative air quality in many metropolitan areas have \nelevated the need for a successful public transportation system to ease the reliance on the private means \nof transportation. Cities that choose to invest in effective public transportation options stand out to gain \nin the long run. Cities that have convenient access to public transport, including access by persons with \ndisabilities are more preferred as these are more likely to offer lower transportation costs while \nimproving on the environment, congestion and travel times within the city. At the same time, improving \nthe access to areas with a high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, \nphysically challenged individuals, and low income earners or areas with specific dwelling types such as \nhigh occupancy buildings or public housing also helps increase the efficiency and the sustainability of the \npublic transport system. Public transport is a very important equalizer of income, consumption and \nspatial inequalities. This indicator is empirically proven that public transport makes cities more inclusive, \nsafe and sustainable. Effective and low-cost transportation is critical for reducing urban poverty and \ninequalities and enhancing economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, \neducation services and other public goods.  \n \nClean public transport is a very efficient mean for the reduction of CO2 emissions and therefore it \ncontributes to climate change and lower levels of energy consumption. Most importantly public transport \nneed to be easily accessible to the elderly and disabled citizens. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThis indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public \ntransport. Because most public transport users walk from their trip origins to public transport stops and \nfrom public transport stops to their trip destination, local spatial availability and accessibility is \nsometimes evaluated in terms of pedestrian (walk) access, as opposed to park and ride or transfers. \n \nHence, the access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is \naccessible within a walking distance along the street network of 500 m from a reference point such as a \nhome, school, work place, market, etc. to a low-capacity public transport system (e.g. bus, Bus Rapid \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: Feb 2021 \n\nTransit) and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system (e.g. rail, metro, ferry).   Additional criteria for defining \npublic transport that is convenient include: \na. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, \nand/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other \npeople in vulnerable situations. \nb. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times \nc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment \n \nThe following definitions are required to define and measure convenient access to public transport.  \n\nCity or urban area: Since 2016 UN-Habitat and partners organized global consultations and discussions to \nnarrow down the set of meaningful definitions that would be helpful for the global monitoring and \nreporting process. Following consultations with 86 member states, the United Nations Statistical \nCommission, in its 51st Session (March 2020) endorsed the Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) as a \nworkable method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical comparisons.1  This \ndefinition combines population size and population density thresholds to classify the entire territory of a \ncountry along the urban-rural continuum, and captures the full extent of a city, including the dense \nneighbourhoods beyond the boundary of the central municipality. DEGURBA is applied in a two-step \nprocess: First, 1 km2 grid cells are classified based on population density, contiguity and population size. \nSubsequently, local units are classified as urban or rural based on the type of grid cells in which majority \nof their population resides. For the computation of indicator 11.2.1, countries are encouraged to adopt \nthe degree of urbanisation to define the analysis area (city or urban area). \n\n \nPublic transport is defined as a shared passenger transport service that is available to the general public \nand is provided for the public good.  It includes cars, buses, trolleys, trams, trains, subways, and ferries \nthat are shared by strangers without prior arrangement. It may also include informal modes of transport \n(para-transit) - but it is noted that these are often lacking in designated routes or stops.. \nFor a city to understand the nature of its transport system and in turn make the necessary planning and \ninvestment decisions, it is recommended to do an inventory of its public transport modes including major \ncharacteristics. For cities where a mix of formal and informal transport systems exist, it is also \nrecommended to disaggregate the indicator findings by the share of population with access to each type \nof transport system, which is critical for decision-making processes. Recent data has shown that many \ncities in developing regions may lack a formal public transport system, but residents still enjoy a high level \nof access to public transport driven by a comprehensive paratransit network which does not necessarily \nhave designated stops. A mapping of the transport routes where these paratransit networks can stop is \nthus recommended, and countries are encouraged to document each type of transport mode.  \n \nStreet Network is defined as a system of interconnected lines that represent a system of streets or roads \nfor a given area. A street network provides the foundation for network analysis that will help to measure \nthe pedestrian access/ walking distance of 500 m or 1 km to a public transport stop; or the network along \nwhich random informal transport modes can be accessed. Some cities have detailed data on their street \nnetwork, type, street design (e.g. availability of a safe walking path) or topological structure of the \nnetwork. However, if such data is not available, it is proposed to use OpenStreetMap as a baseline and fill \nmissing gaps through digitizing of missing lines from satellite imagery (e.g. Google Earth). The major \nassumption in the use of these data sources is that all streets are walkable and on the same elevation \nlevel.  \n                                                           \n1 A recommendation on the method to delineate cities, urban and rural areas for international statistical \ncomparisons. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3j-Recommendation-\nE.pdf  \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: Feb 2021 \n\n \nService Area, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 is defined as the area served by public transport within \n500 m walking distance to a low capacity-system and/or 1 km to a high-capacity system based on the \nstreet network.  \n \nLow-capacity public transport system, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 includes systems such as buses, \ntrams, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which largely run along the street network (including on dedicated \nlanes or tracks that follow the street network). These low-capacity public transport carriers are smaller in \nsize and require less space for stopping-dropping-picking passengers (compared to high capacity carriers \nsuch as metros), meaning their stops can be provided within shorter distances to each other and along \nmajority of the city streets. In countries where informal public transport systems are common, many \nparatransit services will fall under this category of public transport system.  \n \nHigh-capacity public transport system, in the context of indicator 11.2.1 includes systems such as trains, \nmetros and ferries. The carriers in this category of public transport system are large in size and require \nsignificantly large terminus infrastructure (eg metro stations) which makes it impossible to provide their \nstopping-dropping-picking stations (stops) within short distances. Majority of the carriers in this category \nalso operate along dedicated infrastructure (eg metro-lines, waterways) and reach higher speeds than \nlow capacity carriers. Several surveys have indicated that passengers are more likely to walk longer \ndistances to access high-capacity than they would walk to access low-capacity public transport systems.    \n\n \nBuilt up area within the context of indicator 11.2.1 is defined as all areas occupied by buildings.  \n \n \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nExperts in the transport sector, during different Expert Group Meetings held in 2016, 2017 and 2019 \nestablished that measuring accessibility to public transport using the distance to stop metric (spatial \naccess of 500 m or 1 km walking distance to a public transport stop) provides a good measurement of the \nindicator. They however also pointed out that this distance computation is not enough to properly \nmeasure \u201cconvenient access\u201d to public transport.  At a minimum, they recommended that additional \nfeatures of quality be taken into account, as described in the recommended secondary indicators section.  \nEventually, a complete shift to a measure of access of destinations and opportunities would be ideal, if \ndata systems can be developed to support this, and applied in a consistent manner in cities around the \nworld.  \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \nProportion  of  health  facilities  that  have  a  core  set  of  relevant  essential  medicines  available  and \naffordable on a sustainable basis. \n\nThe indicator is a multidimensional index reported as a proportion (%) of health facilities that have a \ndefined core set of quality-assured medicines that are available and affordable relative to the total \nnumber of surveyed health facilities at national level. \n\nRationale: \n\nMeasurement  and  monitoring  of  access  to  essential  medicines  are  of  high  priority  for  the  global \ndevelopment  agenda  given  access  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Universal  Health  Coverage  movement \nand  an  indispensable  element  of  the  delivery  of  quality  health  care.  Access  to  medicines  is  a \ncomposite  multidimensional  concept  that  is  composed  of  the  availability  of  medicines  and  the \naffordability of their prices. Information on these two dimensions has been  collected and analysed \nsince  the 54th  World Health Assembly  in 2001, when Member States  adopted the  WHO Medicines \nStrategy (resolution WHA54.11). This resolution led to the launch of the joint  project on Medicine \nPrices and Availability by WHO and the international non-governmental organization Health Action \nInternational  (HAI/WHO),  as  well  as  a  proposed  HAI/WHO  methodology  for  collecting  data  and \nmeasuring  components  of  access  to  medicines.  To  this  day,  this  methodology  has  been  widely \nimplemented to produce useful analyses of availability and affordability of medicines, however the \ntwo dimensions have been evaluated separately. \n\nWhile the above approach has provided an overview of the countries\u2019 performance and progress on \nimproving  the  affordability  and  availability  of  medicines,  it  has  not  allowed  evaluation  of  overall \naccess to medicines. \n\nThis  evaluation  is  in  turn  essential  as  country\u2019s  success  in  ensuring  one  of  the  dimensions  (e.g. \navailability)  does  not  necessarily  indicate  the  realization  of  the  other  (e.g.  affordability)  and  vice \nversa. For example, a country may focus its policy efforts on ensuring the availability of a core set of \nessential  medicines  in  the  event  of  low  capacity  of  local  production  and/or  challenges  associated \nwith geographic location. As a result of the proposed policies, medicines may become available but \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\ntheir  prices  may  not  be  affordable.  The  opposite  situation  is  also  possible,  as  lowering  prices  of \nmedicines  to  increase  affordability  may  be  too  restrictive  for  some  pharmaceutical  producers  and \nlead  to  a  decreased  supply.  Therefore,  given  the  multidimensionality  of  access  to  medicines,  it  is \nnecessary to evaluate both affordability and availability of medicines at the same time. \n\nThe  proposed  methodology  for  indicator  3.b.3  allows  the  combination  of  both  dimensions  into  a \nsingle  indicator  to  evaluate  the  availability  and  affordability  of  medicines  simultaneously.  This \nmethodology also allows for disaggregation so that each dimension can be analysed separately and \nthe main driver of poor performance of the overall index can be properly identified. \n\nMonitoring the core set of relevant essential medicines is based on the WHO Model List of Essential \nMedicines (EML). The 2017 WHO EML contains 433 medications deemed essential for addressing the \nmost important public health needs globally. The current index is computed based on a subset of 32 \ntracer  essential  medicines  for  the  treatment,  prevention  and  management  of  acute  and  chronic, \ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases in a primary health care setting. \n\nConcepts: \n\nIndicator  3.b.3  is  defined  as  the  \u201cProportion  of  health  facilities  that  have  a  core  set  of  relevant \nessential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis\u201d.  This indicator is based on the \nproportion  of  facilities  (pharmacies,  hospitals,  clinics,  primary  care  centers,  public/private,  etc.) \nwhere core essential medicines from the identified set are available for purchase and their prices are \naffordable, compared to the total number of facilities surveyed.  \n\nThere are several core concepts that are used for measuring indicator 3.b.3:  \n\n1)  Availability of medicine \n2)  Affordability of medicine \n\n\u2192 to define affordability, additional concepts are used: \n\n\u2022  Daily dose treatment of the medicine \n\u2022  National poverty line  \n\u2022  Wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker  \n\n3)  Core set of relevant essential medicines (defined on a global level) \n\n\u2192  to  apply  a  core  set  of  relevant  essential  medicines  defined  on  a  global  level  to  all \ncountries, an additional concept is used: \n\n\u2022  global burden of disease \n\n \n\n1) A medicine is available in a facility when it is found in this facility by the interviewer on the day of \ndata collection.1 Availability is measured as a binary variable with 1 = medicine is available and 0 = \notherwise. \n\n2)  A  medicine  is  affordable  when  no  extra  daily  wages  (EDW)  are  needed  for  the  lowest  paid \nunskilled  government  sector  worker  (LPGW  wage)  to  purchase  a  monthly  dose  treatment  of  this \nmedicine after fulfilling basic needs represented by the  national poverty  line (NPL). Affordability is \nmeasured  as  a  ratio  of  1)  the  sum  of  the  NPL  and  the  price  per  daily  dose  of  treatment  of  the \nmedicine (DDD), over 2) the LPGW salary. This measures the number of extra daily wages needed to \ncover the cost of the medicines in the core set and that can vary between 0 and infinity.   \n\n2.a) Daily dose of treatment (DDD) is an average maintenance dose per day for a medicine \nused  for  its  main  indication  in  adults.2 DDDs  allow  comparisons  of  medicine  use  despite \ndifferences in strength, quantity or pack size. \n\n                                                           \n1 http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/access/OMS_Medicine_prices.pdf  \n2 https://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/  \n\n2 2.b) National poverty line (NLP) is the benchmark for estimating poverty indicators that are \nconsistent with the country's specific economic and social circumstances. NPLs reflect local \nperceptions of the level and composition of consumption or income needed to be non-poor.  \n\n2.c) Wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) is a minimum living wage \nthat  employees  are  entitled  to  receive  to  ensure  overcome  of  poverty  and  reduction  of \ninequalities.3 \n\nIn other words, affordability of a medicine identifies how many (if any) extra daily wages are needed \nfor an individual who earns the LPGW wage to be able to purchase a medicine. The computed EDW \nratio  aims  to  indicate  whether  the  LPGW wage  is  enough  for  the  individual  who  earns  the  lowest \npossible  income  to  cover  1)  the  daily  expenditures  for  food  and  non-food  items  used  to  define \n(relative or absolute) poverty using national standards (NPL) and 2) the daily needs for a medicine \n(DDD).  This  ratio  then  requires  transformation  into a  binary  variable  where  medicine  is  affordable \nwhen zero extra daily wages are required to purchase it and not affordable otherwise. \n\n3) The core set of relevant essential medicines is a list of 32 tracer essential medicines for acute and \nchronic, communicable and non-communicable diseases in the primary health care setting.  \n\nThis basket of medicines has been selected from the 2017 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines \nand used in primary health care.  By definition, essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority \nhealth care needs of the population and are selected for inclusion on the Model List based on due \nconsideration of disease prevalence, evidence of efficacy and safety, and consideration of cost and \ncost-effectiveness.   \n\nThese  medicines  are  listed  in  table  1  of  Annex  1,  where  a  detailed  justification  for  including  each \nmedicine  is  also  provided,  as  well  as  online  references  for  the  relevant  treatment  guidelines  and \nsections in the WHO List of Essential Medicines. \n\nThis  list  of medicines  is  intended  as  a  global  reference.  However,  to  address  regional  and  country \nspecificities in terms of medicine needs, the medicines in this basket are weighted according to the \nregional burden of disease. \n\n3.a) The global burden of disease is an assessment of the health of the world's population. \nMore specifically, disease burden provides information on the global and regional estimates \nof premature mortality, disability and loss of health for causes. The summary measure used \nto  give  an  indication  of  the  burden  of  disease  is  the  disability  adjusted  life  years  (DALYs), \nwhich  represent  a  person\u2019s  loss  of  the  equivalent  of  one  year  of  full  health.  This  metric \nincorporates years of life lost due to death and years of life lost through living in states of \nless than full health (or disability).4 \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n1)  On basket of tracer essential medicines: \n\n \n\n1.1) Although it is possible to regularly monitor all 400+ medicines on the current WHO Model List of \nEssential Medicines, indicator 3.b.3 requires a specific subset of this list. Over the years, several \nbaskets  of  medicines  have  been  defined  for  different  purposes  and  used  to  conduct  data \ncollection  and  monitor  price  and  availability.  This  core  set  of  medicines  does  not  replace  the \nother existing baskets, and WHO teams and partners are encouraged and committed to continue \nad  hoc  monitoring  through  other  existing  channels.  Throughout  the  process  of  identifying  the \ncore  set  of  medicines,  one  area  of  focus  has  been  to  balance  the  selection  of  the  tracer \n\n                                                           \n3 https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/wages/minimum-wages/definition/lang--en/index.htm  \n4 http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n medicines  for  primary  health  care  with  the  size  of  the  basket  itself.  The  proposed  basket \nrepresents a balanced approach to allow that relevant tracer medicines for primary health care \nare  monitored  yet  ensuring  a  practical  and  feasible  data  collection  and  analysis.  The  32 \nmedicines listed in the basket are meant to be indicative of the access to medicines for primary \nhealth care but do not serve as a complete or exhaustive list.  \n\n1.2) As mentioned above, each medicine in the basket is weighted according to the regional Disability \nAdjusted Life Years (DALYs) for relevant disease from the WHO Global health estimates. Regional \nestimates  are  less  sensitive  to  country-by-country  variability  of  data  quality,  they  sufficiently \nillustrate the disease distribution across countries in the region and work well due simplicity and \ncomparability.  Hence,  regional  weights  for  medicines  are  used  to  establish  the  associated \ncountry weights. However, this diminishes the specificity of the basket to the national context. \n \n2)  On the measurement of medicines\u2019 availability: \n\nThe proposed approach for measuring the availability of medicines is based on the presence of the \nmedicine  on  the  day  that  the  interviewer  visits  the  facility  and  does  not  account  for  temporary \nand/or planned stock outs. The 32 medicines identified for the analysis should always be available in \nthe facilities considering that in some (mainly rural) areas, the facility may be very difficult to reach \nand  individuals  may  not  have  resources  to  travel  on  a  daily  basis.  Moreover,  in  this  proposed \nmethodology the price of the medicine does not take into consideration the so-called indirect costs, \nwhich  normally  include  transportation  and  other  costs  to  reach  the  facility.  Thus,  the  proposed \nmeasure for availability presents some limitations.  \n\nFurthermore, given the data collection occurs at the facility level and does not monitor quantities of \nany given medicine, an overall analysis of the available medicines compared to the national needs is \nnot possible. \n\n3)  On the measurement of medicines\u2019 affordability: \n\n3.1)  Affordability  of  a  medicine  is  often  measured  as  the  capacity  of  the  population  of  a  given \ncountry to pay for this medicine either ex-ante (usually based on income) or ex-post (usually based \non reported expenditures). The latter would mainly require data collected at the individual level and \nfrom  household  surveys.  However,  information  on  medicine  expenditures  in  these  surveys  is  not \nalways collected and when collected, is not done so consistently and regularly across the countries. \nIn addition, there is usually a large amount of missing data.  \n\nThe ex-ante approach is suggested for the purposes of this indicator as it is measured at the facility \nlevel.  Ex-ante  analysis  requires  identifying  a  reference  person  or  group  of  people  for  the \nmeasurement. The lowest paid unskilled government worker is suggested to serve as the reference \nfor this indicator. In other words, if a medicine is identified as being affordable for the individual who \nreceives the LPGW wage, it will most likely be affordable for all other individuals affiliated with that \neconomic group and higher. This obviously does not account for people employed in the unofficial \nlabour market.  \n\nThe proposed methodology is an adjusted HAI/WHO methodology. The HAI/WHO approach suggests \ncomputing the  affordability of medicine  prices  as the  number of daily wages that are required for \nthe lowest paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) to purchase a daily dose of a medicine (DDD). \nThis approach is straightforward and also refers to the capacity of the reference individual to pay for \nthe medicines.  However,  no threshold  was  identified  to  distinguish the maximum  number of  daily \nwages that an individual must spend on a medicine in order to still be able to afford it.    \n\n3.2) Information on minimum LPGW wage is available by the International Labour Organization (ILO) \nfor 155 countries. When information is missing or when information has not been updated recently, \nthe alternative measure suggested is to be taken from the World Development  Indicators  data on \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \u201cminimum wage for a 19-year old worker or an apprentice\u201d, which is often used as an alternative in \nILO reports.  \n\n3.3)  The  proposed  indicator,  being  measured  at  the  facility  level,  does  not  account  for  potential \nreimbursement  schemes/insurance  coverage  present  at  the  national  level.  Information  about \ninsurance or other forms of cost-coverage schemes at the national level is not readily available and \nwould  require  standardization  to  allow  for  comparison  across  countries  and  income  levels  of  the \npopulation. However, as demonstrated by the OECD in its Health at a Glance report in 2015, in 31 \nhigh-  and  middle-income  countries  the  out-of-pocket  (OOP)  expenditures on  pharmaceuticals  as  a \nshare of all OOP on health varies from 64 to 16%.5 \n\nMoreover, there are other SDG indicators, such as 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 that capture coverage of essential \nhealth  services  as  well  as  financial  protection  from  health  expenditures  net  of  reimbursement, \nincluding expenditures for medicines. \n\n4)  Other dimensions on access to medicines (quality) \n\nThe quality of the product is another equally important dimension of access to medicines. Currently, \nthere  is no  systematic and publicly  available data collection on quality of a single medicine or in a \nsingle  country.  WHO  has,  however,  contributed  to  enhanced  access  to  quality  health  products \nthrough different programmes such as regulatory systems strengthening and prequalification. \n\nA national regulatory authority (NRA) plays a key role in assuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of \nmedical  products  until  they  reach  the  patient/consumer,  as  well  as  ensuring  the  relevance  and \naccuracy of product information. Hence, stable, well-functioning and integrated regulatory systems \nare  an  essential  component  of  a  health  system  and  contribute  to  better  public  health  outcomes.  \nNRA maturity and WHO prequalification of medicines can be considered as a proxy for ensuring that \nmedicines  in  a  country  are  of  assured  quality.  The  NRA  maturity  level  is  assessed  using  the  WHO \nNational  Regulatory  Authority  Global  Benchmarking  Tool  (WHO  NRA  GBT)6.  After  the  evaluations, \ncountries  are  assigned  one  of  five  levels  of  maturity7,  with  a  score  of  maturity  level  three \nrepresenting the minimum acceptable  regulatory capacity and  maturity level  five  representing the \nhighest level of functioning. \n\nThe importance of transparency and the disclosure of the results of assessments amongst regulators \n(from  ML  3  up)  are  taken  into  consideration.  However,  the  information  on  country-specific  NRA \nmaturity  level  is  not  currently  publicly  available  and  WHO  is  working  to  address  this  limitation \nthrough recent discussions on WHO Listed Authorities (WLA).  \n\n5)  Other comments: \n\nThe  \u201csustainability\u201d  dimension  in  this  indicator  can  be  measured  only  when  more  than  one-time \nseries of computations is available for a specific country so that a trend (tendency of a series of data \npoints to move in a certain direction over time) can be identified. \n\nThe proposed methodology takes advantage of recognized standards and data collection methods, \nproposing  a  recombination  of  dimensions  to  allow  measurement  of  affordability  of  a  core  set  of \nrelevant essential medicines for communicable and non-communicable diseases. \n\n                                                           \n5 https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/health_glance-2017-\nen.pdf?expires=1538398439&id=id&accname=ocid195767&checksum=5048DC3536CBC81347E991B01A182E2A \n\n6 http://www.who.int/medicines/regulation/benchmarking_tool/en/  \n7 Maturity ranges between four levels starting from (1) some elements of regulatory systems exist; (2) evolving national \nregulatory system that partially performs essential regulatory functions; (3) stable well-functioning and integrated \nregulatory system; (4) regulatory system operating at advanced level of performance and continuous improvement. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n "

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThe proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation is \ndefined as the proportion of transboundary basins area within a country with an operational \n\narrangement for water cooperation. It is derived by adding up the surface area in a country of those \n\ntransboundary surface water catchments and transboundary aquifers (i.e. \u2018transboundary\u2019 basins) that \n\nare covered by an operational arrangement and dividing the obtained area by the aggregate total area in \n\na country of all transboundary basins (both catchments and aquifers). The result is multiplied by 100 to \n\nobtain it expressed as percentage share. \n\nRationale: \n\nMost of the world\u2019s water resources are shared: 592 transboundary aquifers have been identified and \n\ntransboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth\u2019s land surface and account for an \n\nestimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world\u2019s population lives in river and lake \n\nbasins shared by two or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. Development \n\nof water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on co-riparian countries, and use \n\nof surface water or groundwater may affect the other resource, these usually being interlinked. Intensive \n\nwater use, flow regulation or pollution risks going as far as compromising co-riparian countries\u2019 \n\ndevelopment aspirations and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, cooperation is \n\nin most cases not advanced.  \n\nSpecific agreements or other arrangements concluded between co-riparian countries are a key \n\nprecondition to ensure long-term, sustainable cooperation. International customary water law (as \n\nreflected in the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses (New \n\nYork, 1997), the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International \n\nLakes (Helsinki, 1992), and the draft Articles on The Law of Transboundary Aquifers (2008; UN General \n\nAssembly resolutions 63/124, 66/104, and 68/118)), as well as existing experience and good practices, all \n\npoint to minimum requirements for operational cooperation. These minimum requirements are captured \n\nby the four criteria for operationality.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is the basis for the explicit call for transboundary water cooperation in the wording of target 6.5 and \n\nthe importance of monitoring this indicator to complement indicator 6.5.1 which measures the \n\nadvancement of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). \n\nProgress by a particular country towards the cooperation aspect of target 6.5, reflected by the value of \n\nindicator 6.5.2, can be achieved either by establishing new operational cooperation arrangements with \n\nco-riparian countries, or making existing arrangements operational by developing and regularizing \n\nactivities, or expanding the coverage of cooperation arrangements with the ultimate objective to cover \n\nall surface waters and groundwaters. \n\nConcepts: \n\n\"The proposed monitoring has as basis the spatial coverage of transboundary basins shared by each \n\ncountry, and focuses on monitoring whether these are covered by cooperation arrangements that are \n\noperational. The criteria needing to be met for the cooperation on a specific basin being considered \n\n\u201coperational\u201d seeks to capture whether the arrangement(s) indeed provide an adequate basis for \n\ncooperation in water management.  \n\nTransboundary basins are basins of transboundary waters, that is, of any surface waters (notably rivers, \n\nlakes) or groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between by two or more states. \n\nFor the purpose of the calculation of this indicator, for surface waters, the basin is the extent of the \n\ncatchment area; for groundwater, the area considered is the extent of the aquifer.  \n\nArrangement for water cooperation: a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other \n\nformal arrangement, such as memorandum of understanding) between riparian countries that provides a \n\nframework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Agreements or other kind of formal \n\narrangements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial, interagency or between regional \n\nauthorities.  \n\nOperational: For an agreement or other kind of formal arrangement (e.g. a memorandum of \n\nunderstanding) for cooperation between the riparian countries to be considered operational, all the \n\nfollowing criteria needs to be fulfilled:  \n\n- There is a joint body, joint mechanism or commission (e.g. a river basin organization) for transboundary \n\ncooperation  \n\n- There are regular formal communications between riparian countries in form of meetings  \n\n- There is a joint or coordinated water management plan(s), or joint objectives have been set \n\n- There is a regular exchange of data and information. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLast updated: 18 November 2016 \n\nThe spatial information on transboundary surface water basins\u2019 boundaries and the extents of the \n\ncatchment areas are commonly available and essentially static; consequently, once determined, no \n\nupdating need is expected. \n\nThe information on the areal extent of transboundary aquifers may evolve over time as such information \n\nis generally more coarse but likely to improve because of the evolving knowledge on aquifers. Technical \n\nstudies and exchange of information will improve the delineation and might also lead to the identification \n\nof additional transboundary aquifers. \n\nIn situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin, but only some of them have \n\noperational cooperation arrangements, the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country \n\ndoes not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours. Such \n\ncomplementary information can be obtained by aggregating data at the level of the basins but not from \n\nthe reporting at the national level.  \n\nThe legal basis for cooperation develops slowly: conclusion of new agreements on transboundary waters \n\nis commonly a long process that takes many years.  \n\nThe operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation. The \n\noperationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames, and in a year or two, progress could \n\npotentially be observed. \n\n \n"

Violence against women shall be understood to \nencompass, but not be limited to, the following: [\u2026], Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring \nwithin the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, \nin educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution [\u2026]\u201d. See here for \nfull definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm \n\nSexual  violence  is  defined  as  any  sort  of  harmful  or  unwanted  sexual  behaviour  that  is  imposed  on \nsomeone.  It  includes  acts  of  abusive  sexual  contact,  forced  engagement  in  sexual  acts,  attempted  or \ncompleted  sexual  acts  without  consent,  incest,  sexual  harassment,  etc.  However,  in  most  surveys  that \ncollect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n to  forcing  someone  into  sexual  intercourse when  she does not  want  to,  as  well as  attempting  to  force \nsomeone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse.  \n\nFor a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on \nViolence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014). \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nComparability: \n\nThe availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have \nrelied on different survey methodologies and used different definitions of sexual violence and different \nsurvey question formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences \nof violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and \nthis can affect reported prevalence levels. \n\nEfforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of \nsexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries. \n\nRegularity of data production: \n\nSince 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and \ngirls.  Obtaining  data  on  violence  against  women  and  girls  is  a  costly  and  time-consuming  exercise,  no \nmatter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other \nsurveys.

Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances \nof illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable.

To the extent possible, all efforts should be made to also \ndisaggregate results by disability status and by \u2018nationally relevant population groups\u2019. \n\nConcepts: \n\u2022  Public  services:  As  stated  by  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights,  \u201cStates  are \nresponsible for delivering a variety of services to their populations, including education, health and \nsocial welfare services. The provision of these services is essential to the protection of human rights \nsuch  as  the  right  to  housing,  health,  education  and  food.  The  role  of  the  public  sector  as  service \nprovider or regulator of the private provision of services is crucial for the realization of all human rights, \nparticularly social and economic rights.\u201d4  \n \nWhile several definitions of \u2018public services\u2019 exist, they tend to have in common a focus on \u2018common \ninterest'  and  on  \u2018government  responsibility\u2019.  For  instance,  the  European  Commission  defines  such \nservices as \u201cServices that public authorities of the Member States clarify as being of general interest \nand, therefore, subject to specific public service obligations.\u201d5 Similarly, the African Charter on Values \nand Principles of Public Service and Administration (African Union, 2011) defines a public service as \n\u201cAny service or public-interest activity that is under the authority of the government administration\u201d.  \n \n\n\u2022  Public services \u2018of general interest\u2019: The methodology for SDG 16.6.2 carefully defines the scope of \nhealthcare and education services to ensure that the focus is placed on services that are truly of general \ninterest. In the case of healthcare services, for instance, preventive and primary healthcare services \ncan be said to be truly \u2018of general interest\u2019: these services are relevant to everyone and they are most \ncommonly found in both urban and rural areas. This might not be the case for hospitals that provide \ntertiary care, and as such hospital and specialist care is excluded from the questions on healthcare \nservices. Likewise, in the case of education services, primary and lower secondary education services \ncan be said to be truly \u2018of general interest\u2019, given their universality. University education, however, is \nexcluded from the questions on education services.  \n \n\u2018Last experience\u2019 of public services in the past 12 months: Indicator 16.6.2 focuses on respondents\u2019 \n\u2018last experience of public services\u2019, and specifies a reference period of \u201cthe past 12 months\u201d to avoid \ntelescoping effects and to minimize memory bias effects. This means that only respondents who will \nhave  used  healthcare,  education  and  government  services  in  the  past  12  months  will  proceed  to \nanswer the survey questions.  \n\n\u2022 \n\nService-specific standards \u2013 or \u2018attributes\u2019: The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \nexplains  that  \u201cA  human  rights-based  approach  to  public  services  is  integral  to  the  design, delivery, \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  all  public  service  provision.  Firstly,  the  normative  human  rights \nframework provides an important legal yardstick for measuring how well public service is designed and \n\n                                                           \n4 Good Governance Practices for the Protection of Human Rights (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.07.XIV.10), p. 38 \u2013 \ncited in Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the role of the public service as an essential \ncomponent of good governance in the promotion and protection of human rights, Human Rights Council, 25th Session, 23 \nDecember 2013, A/HRC/25/27   \n5 European Commission\u2019s 2011 Communication regarding \u2018A Quality Framework for Services of General Interest in Europe\u2019, \np. 3  \n\n \n\u2022 \n\n delivered and whether the benefits reach rights-holders\u201d6. For instance, the Committee on Economic, \nSocial  and  Cultural  Rights  specifies  that  \u201cThe  availability,  accessibility,  acceptability  and  quality  of \nhealth-related services should be facilitated and controlled by States. This duty extends to a variety of \nhealth-related services ranging from controlling the spread of infectious diseases to ensuring maternal \nhealth and adequate facilities for children.\u201d7 Similarly, with respect to education services, the same \nCommittee underlines that \u201cStates should adopt a human rights approach to ensure that [education \nservices  are]  of  an  adequate  standard  and  do  not  exclude  any  child  on  the  basis  of  race,  religion, \ngeographical location or any other defining characteristic.\u201d8   \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Healthcare services: The questions on healthcare services focus on respondents\u2019 experiences (or that \nof a child in their household who needed treatment and was accompanied by the respondent)  with \nprimary healthcare services (over the past 12 months) \u2013 that is, basic health care services provided by \na  government/public  health  clinic,  or  covered  by  a  public  health system.  It  can include  health care \nservices provided by private institutions, as long as such services are provided at reduced (or no) cost \nto beneficiaries, under a public health system. Respondents are specifically asked not to include in their \nanswers  any  experience  they  might  have  had  with  hospital  or  specialist  medical  care  services  (for \nexample, if they had a surgery), or with dental care and teeth exams (because in many countries, dental \ncare is not covered by publicly funded healthcare systems). Attributes-based questions on healthcare \nservices  focus  on  1)  Accessibility  (related  to  geographic  proximity,  delay  in  getting  appointment, \nwaiting time to see doctor on day of appointment); 2) Affordability; 3) Quality of facilities; 4) Equal \ntreatment for everyone; and 5) Courtesy and treatment (attitude of healthcare staff). \n \n\n\u2022  Education services: The questions on education services focuses on respondents\u2019 experience with the \npublic school system over the past 12 months, that is, if there are children in their household whose \nage falls within the age range spanning primary and secondary education in the country. Public schools \nare defined as \u201cthose for which no private tuition fees or major payments must be paid by the parent \nor guardian of the child who is attending the school; they are state-funded schools.\u201d Respondents are \nasked to respond separately for primary and secondary schools if children in their household attend \nschool at different levels. Attributes-based questions on education services focus on 1) Accessibility \n(with a focus on geographic proximity); 2) Affordability; 3) Quality of facilities; 4) Equal treatment for \neveryone; and 5) Effective delivery of service (Quality of teaching). \n\n\u2022  Government  services:  The  battery  on  government  services  focuses  exclusively  on  two  types  of \ngovernment  services:  1)  Services  to  obtain  government-issued  identification  documents  (such  as \nnational  identity  cards,  passports,  driver\u2019s  licenses  and  voter\u2019s  cards)  and  2)  services  for  the  civil \nregistration of life events such as births, marriages and deaths. This particular focus on these two types \nof  services  arises  from  the  high  frequency  of  use  of  these  services.  Attributes-based  questions  on \ngovernment  services  focus  on  1)  Accessibility;  2)  Affordability;  3)  Equal  treatment  for  everyone;  4) \nEffective delivery of service (delivery process is simple and easy to understand); and 5) Timeliness.  \n\n \nSelection of relevant disaggregation dimensions   \n\n\u2022  Relevant international legal frameworks: Indicator 16.6.2 aims to provide a better understanding \nof  how  access  to  services  and  the  quality  of  services  differ  across  localities  and  across  various \ndemographic groups. This aim is supported by international human rights law:   \n\n \n\n                                                           \n6 Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the role of the public service as an essential \ncomponent of good governance in the promotion and protection of human rights, Human Rights Council, 25th Session, 23 \nDecember 2013, A/HRC/25/27   \n7 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest \nattainable standard of health, para. 4.   \n8 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to education, para. 1.   \n -  Article 25 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for the \nright to equal access to public service. In its report on the role of the public services as an \nessential component in the promotion and protection of human rights, the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights reminds that \u201cStates must bear in mind that there \nare  demographic groups  in every  society  that  may  be disadvantaged  in  their  access  to \npublic services, namely women, children, migrants, persons with disabilities, indigenous \npersons and older persons. States need to ensure that the human rights of these groups \nare  not  undermined  and  that  they  receive  adequate  public  services.\u201d 9  The  High \nCommissioner  also  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  \u201cPoverty  acts  as  a  major  barrier  in \nrelation to public services.\u201d   \n\n- \n\nThe obligations to ensure equality and non-discrimination are recognized in article 2 of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are encountered in many United Nations \nhuman rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n(arts. 2 and 26), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2 \n(2)), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 2), the International Convention on \nthe Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 7) \nand the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 5). In terms of public \nservices, this means that States have an immediate obligation to ensure that deliberate, \ntargeted measures are put into place to secure substantive equality and that all individuals \nhave an equal opportunity to enjoy their right to access public services. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022  Empirical analysis: Statistical analysis of available datasets on citizen satisfaction with healthcare \nand education services10 shows that the demographic variables that are most strongly correlated \nwith  satisfaction  with  healthcare  and  education  services  are  (1)  income  (by  far  the  strongest \ndeterminant of satisfaction levels), (2) sex, and (3) place of residence (rural/urban). There is no \nstatistically significant association between the age of respondents and satisfaction levels.  \n\n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \n \nThis indicator Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris \nPrinciples measures the compliance of existing national human rights institutions with the Principles \nrelating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), which were adopted by the General \nAssembly (resolution 48/134) based on the rules of procedure of the Global Alliance of National Human \nRights Institutions (GANHRI, formerly the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions \nfor the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights or ICC). \n \nRationale: \n \nThis indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national \ninstitutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. \nThe creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State\u2019s commitment to promote and protect the human \nrights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest \nNHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights \nsituation, and publicize human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially \nstate funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial \ncompetence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an \nessential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that \nNHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important \nactors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws \nand the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws. At the national level reporting, the \nbetter the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and \neffective in promoting human rights at the national level. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nConcepts: \n \nA National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote \nand protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to \nprotect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. \nHowever, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may \nvary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the \nprotection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include \ncomplaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective \nNHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the \n'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of \nNHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights \nombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centers and \nmultiple institutions. An Independent NHRI is an institution with \u2018A level\u2019 accreditation status as \nbenchmarked against the Paris Principles. The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review \nby the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GAHNRI. There are three possible types of \naccreditation:  \n \nA: Compliance with Paris Principles  \nB: Observer Status \u2013 Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided \nto make a determination  \nC: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles  \n \nAccreditation by the GANHRI entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and \npractice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as \nwith the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken \ninto account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in \nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human \nrights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. \nThe process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights \nsystems. \n \nThe Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles) adopted by General \nAssembly, Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993 provide the international benchmarks against which \nNHRIs can be accredited by the GANHRI. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human \nrights has been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final \nDocument and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA \nresolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on National institutions for the promotion \nand protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been \nencouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 \u2018affirms the priority that should be accorded to \nthe development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nimplementation of international human rights standards\u2019 while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 \nencouraged states \u2018to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous \nOmbudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions\u2019. The Human Rights Council (HRC \nresolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its \ninstitution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work.  \n \nUN treaty bodies have also recognized the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective \nimplementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, \nA/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, \nCRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to \nNHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: \nhttp://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/.  \n \nThe GANHRI is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in \naccordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human \nrights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted \ndocuments such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered \nin its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential \ndecree, 2) outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of \nrecent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. \nNHRIs that hold \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organizations may also \nprovide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter.  \n \nAccreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However \ntheir effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of \ntheir human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the \nNHRI to the recommendations of the GANHRI. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with \nthe international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, \nand to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their \nmandate in reference to international human rights instruments. \n \n"

Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and \nfreight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows \na robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-\neconomic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but \nalso because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease \noutbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the \naffected persons in the affected areas.

It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure \nsecurity for all, including women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n\nIndicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, \nwetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure \ntypes  as  recognized  at  the  country  level,  such  as  freehold,  leasehold,  public  land,  customary  land.  An \nindividual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, \nor collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association.  \n \nSecure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) \nperception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure \nsecurity.  \n \nLegally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication \nof information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by \ngovernment, and is therefore official.  For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country \nspecific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized \n(see next section for rationale).  \n \nPerceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual\u2019s perception of the \nlikelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to \nuse it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without \nland rights\u2019 documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with \ndocumentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are \ninsufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, \nindividuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing \nand analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land \ntenure security, based on a country specific context.   \n \nFor purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of \ntenure to be secure if:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five \nyears due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and  \nThe landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land.  \n\n \n\nTotal adult population:  A country\u2019s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using \nan adequate sampling frame.   \n \nRationale: \n\nTenure systems increasingly face stress as the world\u2019s growing population requires food security, and as \nurbanization,  environmental  degradation  and  climate  affect  land  use  and  productivity.  Many  tenure \nproblems also arise because of weak land governance, disputes due to land acquisition or large-scale land-\nbased investments, and attempts to address tenure problems associated with dualisms to tenure regimes. \n\n                                                           \n\n1 Group rights include shared or collective rights, and examples include the ejido in Mexico, indigenous territories in Honduras, perpetual \nDUAT for rural communities in Mozambique. Collective rights occur in a situation where holders of rights to land and natural resources are \nclearly defined as a collective group and have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights.    \n2 Country specific legal definition of an \u2018adult\u2019 will be applied. \n\n\fLast reviewed: Oct 2020 \n\nResponsible governance of tenure of land is inextricably linked with access to and management of other \nnatural resources, such as forests, water, fisheries and mineral resources. The governance of tenure is a \ncrucial  element  in  determining  if  and  how  people,  communities  and  others  acquire  rights,  and  their \nassociated obligations, to use and control land and natural resources.  Legal recognition to group tenure or \nadopting a \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 land administration and using these to recognize outer boundaries of land held \nunder  communal  or  customary  arrangements  have  increasingly  received  government  attention  in  the \nrecent past.  \n\nIncreasing demand for pro-poor land reforms has created the need for a core set of land indicators that \nhave  national  application and  global  comparability,  and  culminated  in  SDG 1.4.23.  Regular  reporting  on \nindicator 1.4.2 will provide an impetus to improve the availability of data from surveys as well as regularity \nof  reporting  on  land  administration  service  delivery  to  people  by  registries  and  other  line  agencies. \nIndicator 1.4.2 thus measures gender disaggregated progress in tenure security. \n\nAll  forms  of  tenure  should  provide  people  with  a  degree  of  tenure  security,  with  states  protecting \nlegitimate tenure rights, ensuring that people are not arbitrarily evicted and that their legitimate tenure \nrights  are  not  otherwise  extinguished  or  infringed.  Perceptions  of  tenure  security  matter  because  they \ninfluence the way that land is used. Sources of perceived insecurity may include contestation from within \nhouseholds, families, communities or as a result of the actions of governments or private land claimants. \nSecure tenure rights for women require particular attention and could be affected by a number of factors, \nincluding intra-household power relations, community level inequalities, or different tenure regimes, and \nwhich can be cross tabulated against other factors of difference to ensure that women are no left behind. \nIf measured at the individual level, the right to bequeath is another proxy of perception of tenure security. \nWomen\u2019s  ability  to  influence  intergenerational  land  transfers  is  an  important  aspect  of  female \nempowerment (and one way in which this indicator links with indicator 5.a.1). \n\n \u201cLegally recognized documentation\u201d and \u201cperception of tenure security\u201d are two complementary parts of \nthis indicator and which reflects several insights, namely (i) land is a key asset that is essential for poverty \nreduction, human rights and equality of opportunity including by gender; (ii) secure land tenure creates \nincentives for investment in land, allows land to be transferred, and creates the institutional precondition \nfor use of land as collateral to access finance for economic activity; (iii) there is a need to complement \nformal measures of tenure security with perception-based measures. \n\nThis indicator will inform policy and allow for the assessment of specific outcomes and practical priorities \nfor further improvements of tenure security at the country level. Regular reporting on the two components \nof Indicator 1.4.2 will: \n\n\u2022  provide incentives for governments to improve performance on progress with responsible land \n\ngovernance \ninform  governments  and  non-state  actors  to  what  extent  countries\u2019  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks recognize and support different land-tenure categories \n\n\u2022  provide  information  on  implementation  capacity  to  protect  such  rights  in  practice,  as  well  as \n\nprogress  \nidentify the scope for additional action required at the country level as well as at a subnational \nlevel or for certain categories, geographic entities or ecosystems, and \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  provide for equity between men and women in land rights.  \n\n \n\nInterpretation: \n\n                                                           \n\n3 This  need  for  data  led  to  a  collaboration  between  UN-Habitat,  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  and  the  World  Bank  in  2012, \nfacilitated by the Global Land Tool Network, to develop a set of core land indicators to measure tenure security globally and at country level; \nthe process saw the start of the Global Land Indicators Initiative (GLII), a platform used by the global land community to underscore the \nneed for tenure security through evidence-based policymaking through more and better data.  \n \n\n\fLast reviewed: Oct 2020 \n\nOne motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between \ndata on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, \ntenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of \ncustomary  systems  and  trusted  local  land  governance  arrangements.  Or,  the  opposite,  tenure  may  be \nperceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation \ncan be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated \ndocuments, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.  \n\nReporting  on  perceived  security  will  provide  important  information  on  people\u2019s  satisfaction  with  the \ninstitutional  quality  of  service,  transparency,  appropriateness,  accessibility  and  affordability  of  land \nadministration services and justice systems.  \n \nComments and limitations: \n\nIn 2016, a total of 116 countries reported having electronic land information systems in place. Countries \nwith paper-based systems will have more difficulties with reporting on administrative data and household \nsurveys will be the main source of data for this indicator in these countries. The expansion of digitization \nof records and land data management is one way to facilitate the ease of reporting administrative data for \nthis indicator. Coverage may, however, be geographically skewed, for example towards urban or specific \nrural regions where cadastral coverage is concentrated, and therefore sub-national dimensions should be \nproperly considered and conveyed in narrative reporting by specific countries to accompany the headline \ndata.  \n\nIn  federal  countries  with  decentralized  land  registry  systems  and  no  centralized  reporting  yet,  data \nreporting systems for aggregation will be put in place. For countries where the land administration system \ndoes not yet collect information on gender, and gender disaggregation cannot be computed using other \ncore  data  (social  security  numbers,  ID  etc),  land  agencies  are  encouraged  to  start  expanding  this  by \nrecording also the gender of owners/users of newly registered land.  \n\nMost  of  the  national  household  surveys\u2019  target  samples  are  sufficiently  large  to  provide  the  statistical \npower  for  disaggregation  by  sex  and  tenure  type  at  rural  /urban  and  sub-national  levels.  Inferring  the \nextent to which the adult population is tenure secure based on the existing web of surveys, will require the \nuse  of  a  standardized  set  of  questions  so  that  surveys  can  be  combined.  However,  even  nationally \nrepresentative surveys tend to cover certain segments of the population (those living in agricultural areas, \nfamilies in which there are women of reproductive age, official urban areas etc.). Even when all the existing \nsurveys are aggregated, there may be pockets of the population that are not captured by the surveys and \nfor which there is thus no data on tenure security. This may include families living in areas that are too far \nor costly to reach, like forest areas.  \n\nHousehold surveys generally collect household-level data from proxy respondents. Family members who \nare not the head or the most knowledgeable person in their households are not interviewed,  as is also \nnoted  in  the  methodological  note  for  the  IAEG-SDG  Secretariat  for  Indicator  5.a.1.  This  approach  is \nproblematic for measuring tenure rights and security due to the introduction of non-random measurement \nerrors4. For instance, proxy reporting by one member of the household tends to incorrectly assign rights \nand misjudge and underestimate both women\u2019s and men\u2019s rights and use of land. Indicator 1.4.2 should \ntherefore be based on self-reported rather than proxy data. If not all household members are surveyed, \nonly  those  surveyed  should  be  reported,  estimating  the  global  adult  population  based  on  the  smaller \nsample enumerated. This lack of information affects only the numerators of the indicator; it has no bearing \non  the  denominator  which  should  always  be  the  total  adult  population.    In  other  words,  the  indicator \nreports and tracks the proportion of the population for which there is self-reported data stating that they \nare tenure secure. People for whom there is no information cannot be assumed to be tenure secure and \n                                                           \n4 Findings from the Methodological Experiment on Measuring Asset Ownership from A Gender Perspective (MEXA) experiment revealed \nthat data from proxy respondents yield different estimates than self-reported data, with variations by asset, by type of ownership and by \nthe sex of the owner. For instance, the study found that self-reported data increase both women\u2019s and men\u2019s reported ownership of \nagricultural land in Uganda. Such increase is greater for men (15 percentage points) than for women (10 percentage points), and is less \npronounced when we consider documented ownership (+7 percentage points for men and +2 percentage points for women) (Kilic and \nMoylan, 20160. \n\n\fLast reviewed: Oct 2020 \n\ntherefore are not counted in the numerator. NSOs should report the data collected from household surveys \nas individual level data that corresponds to the respondent and is not extrapolated to the rest of his/her \nhousehold. Any limitations in the representativeness of this data should be clearly noted in the country \nspecific metadata submitted with the reporting, including who was included in the enumeration.  \n\nData will still be used for countries that do not yet have survey instruments in place that survey individuals, \nwhile  capacity  for  expanding  sampling  and  individual  self-reporting  by  NSOs  is  expanded  progressively \nthrough DHS, MICS, LSMS and other type of surveys in coordination with FAO and UN-Women. Addressing \nthis challenge will require combined efforts. Custodians of the land rights indicators1.4.2 and 5.a.1, and \nrelevant  stakeholders  from  the  land  sector,  will  work  with  custodians  from  other  SDG  indicators  also \nrequire surveying of individuals, and in particular the NSOs, to identify effective approaches to start filling \nthe void on self-reported data. NSOs need to be supported to collect data by interviewing individual adult \nhousehold  member.  The  custodians  will  leverage  the  work  of  the  UN  -  Evidence  and  Data  for  Gender \nEquality  EDGE  project5,  in  particular,  which  is  the  most  advanced  in  using  and  testing  gender  sensitive \nmethodologies  and  approaches.  They  have  found  the  approach  feasible  and  have  developed  training \nmaterials and data collection instruments suitable for this effort.  \n \n"

This indicator is disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1) drugs, \n(2) alcohol and other psychoactive substances.  \n \nWhenever  possible,  this  indicator  is  additionally  disaggregated  by  type  of  treatment  interventions \n(pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services). The proposed indicator will be \naccompanied, with contextual information on availability coverage, i.e. treatment capacity for substance \nuse disorders generated at national level to provide additional information for interpretation of the contact \ncoverage data. \n \n\nRationale: \nAccording to UNODC and WHO data, around 271 million people aged 15 to 64 years worldwide used an \nillicit drug at least once in 2017, about 2.3 billion people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of \npeople suffer from drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders. \n \nSubstance  use  disorders  are  serious  health  conditions  that  present  a  significant  burden  for  affected \nindividuals, their families and communities. Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to \nsociety including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, \nsocial welfare, and other social consequences.

SDG  indicator  3.5.1  is  crucial  for  measurement  the  progress  towards  strengthening  the \ntreatment of substance abuse worldwide as formulated in the Target 3.5.  \n \nConcepts: \nThe  central  concept  of  \u201csubstance  abuse\u201d  in  the  SDG  health target  3.5  implies  the  use  of  psychoactive \nsubstances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes, e.g. perception, \nconsciousness,  cognition  or  affect.  The  concept  of  \u201csubstance  use  disorders\u201d  includes  both  \u201cdrugs  use \ndisorders\u201d and \u201calcohol use disorders\u201d according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and \nICD-11). \n \nThe  term  \u201cdrugs\u201d  refers  to  controlled  psychoactive  substances  as  scheduled  by  the  three  Drug  Control \nConventions (1961, 1971 and 1988), substances controlled under national legislation and new psychoactive \nsubstances  (NPS)  that  are  not  controlled  under  the  Conventions,  but  may  pose  a  public  health  threat. \n\u201cAlcohol\u201d  refers  to  ethanol  -  a  psychoactive  substance  with  dependence  producing  properties  that  is \nconsumed in ethanol-based or alcoholic beverages.  \n \nPeople with substance use disorders are those with harmful substance use and/or affected by substance \ndependence. Harmful substance use is defined in the ICD-11 as a pattern of use of substances that has \ncaused damage to a person\u2019s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the \nhealth of others. According to ICD-11, dependence arises from repeated or continuous use of psychoactive \nsubstances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use  psychoactive substance, which is \nmanifested  by  impaired  ability  to  control  use,  increasing  priority  given  to  use  over  other  activities  and \npersistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. \n \nTreatment of substance use disorder -any structured intervention that is aimed specifically to a) reduce \nsubstance use and cravings for substance use; b) improve health, well-being and social functioning of the \naffected individual, and c) prevent future harms by decreasing the risk of complications and relapse. These \nmay include pharmacological treatment, psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation and aftercare. All \nevidence-based used for treatment of substance use disorders are well defined in WHO and UNODC related \ndocuments.  \n \nPharmacological treatment refers to interventions that include detoxification, opioid agonist maintenance \ntherapy (OAMT) and antagonist maintenance (WHO, UNODC International Standards for the treatment of \ndrug use disorders, 2016).  \n \nPsychosocial interventions refer to programs that address motivational, behavioral, psychological, social, \nand environmental factors related to substance use and have been shown to reduce drug use, promote \nabstinence and prevent relapse. For different drug use disorders, the evidence from clinical trials supports \nthe effectiveness of treatment planning, screening, counselling, peer support groups, cognitive behavioral \ntherapy  (CBT),  motivational  interviewing  (MI),  community  reinforcement  approach  (CRA),  motivational \nenhancement therapy (MET), family therapy (FT) modalities, contingency management (CM), counselling, \ninsight-oriented treatments, housing and employment support among others. (UNODC WHO International \nStandards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders, 2016). \n \nRehabilitation and aftercare (Recovery Management and Social Support) refers to interventions that are \nbased on scientific evidence and focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration \ndedicated to treat drug use disorders.  \n\n\fLast update: 20 September 2019 \n\nComments and limitations: \nThe  two  main  challenges  in  terms  of  computing  the  SDG  3.5.1  indicator  are  the  limited  availability  of \nhousehold surveys on substance use and the under-reporting of use among survey respondents. \nData reported from household surveys are one of the sources of information on of the number of people \nwith substance use disorders. There are issues of under-reporting for certain psychoactive substances, in \ncountries where stigma is associated to substance use and when a considerable proportion of the drug or \nalcohol  using  population  is  institutionalized,  homeless  or  unreachable  by  population-based  surveys. \nAdditionally, being a relatively rare event, household surveys on substance use disorders require a large \nsample and can be costly. In order to address these issues, additional approaches (e.g. scale up methods) \nare increasingly used in household surveys to address undercount issues. These can be used in conjunction \nwith special  studies  and/or  additional  information,  in  order  to  obtain reasonable estimates via  indirect \nmethods, such as benchmark/multiplier or capture-recapture methods.  \n \nAn additional step in data validation and country capacity building for monitoring treatment coverage for \nsubstance use disorders will be implemented during the next couple of years for in-depth data generation \nin  a  sample  of  countries  from  different  regions  and  representing  different  levels  of  health  system \ndevelopment. A rapid assessment tool for in-depth data generation is in the process of development by \nWHO. \n \nThe  indicator  stresses  on  type,  availability  and  coverage  of  services  but  does  not  necessarily  provide \ninformation on the actual quality of the interventions/services provided. To address this, at national level, \nthe  proposed  treatment  indicator  will  be  accompanied  with  contextual  information  on  availability \ncoverage,  i.e.  treatment  capacity  for  substance  use  disorders  to  provide  additional  information  for \ninterpretation of the contact coverage data. \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \n \nThe growth rate in the welfare aggregate of bottom 40% is computed as the annualized average growth \nrate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution in a country \nfrom household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. The national average growth rate in the welfare \naggregate is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income \nof the total population in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. \n \nRationale: \n \nImprovements in shared prosperity require both a growing economy and a consideration of equity. \nShared prosperity explicitly recognizes that while growth is necessary for improving economic welfare in \na society, progress is measured by how those gains are shared with its poorest members. Moreover, in an \ninclusive society it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an absolute minimum standard of living; it \nmust ensure that economic growth increases prosperity among the poor over time. \n \nThe decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken to ignore the \nmany other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, \ncommunicate, and measure\u2014though measurement challenges exist. Indeed, shared prosperity \ncomprises many dimensions of well-being of the less well-off, and when analyzing shared prosperity in \nthe context of a country, it is important to consider a wide range of indicators of welfare. \n \nConcepts: \n \nPromoting shared prosperity is defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the \nwelfare distribution in every country and is measured by calculating the annualized growth of mean per \ncapita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent. The choice of the bottom 40 percent as the \ntarget population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40 percent differs across countries \ndepending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting \nshared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThere are mainly two limitations of shared prosperity indicators: data availability and data quality.  \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: September 2020 \n\nData availability \n \nLack of household survey data is even more problematic for monitoring shared prosperity than for \nmonitoring poverty. To monitor shared prosperity, two surveys of a country have to be conducted within \nfive years or so during a chosen period, namely circa 2007-12. They have to be reasonably comparable to \neach other in terms of both the survey design and the construction of the welfare aggregates. Thus, not \nevery survey that can generate poverty estimates can generate shared prosperity estimates.  \n \nThe second consideration is the coverage of countries, with data that are as recent as possible. Since \nshared prosperity must be estimated and used at the country level, there are good reasons for obtaining \na wide coverage of countries, regardless of the size of their population. Moreover, for policy purposes it \nis important to have indicators for the most recent period possible for each country. The selection of \nsurvey years and countries needs to be made consistently and transparently, achieving a balance \nbetween matching the time period as closely as possible across all countries, including the most recent \ndata, and ensuring the widest possible coverage of countries, across regions and income levels. In \npractice, this means that time periods will not match perfectly across countries. This is a compromise: \nwhile it introduces a degree of incomparability, it also creates a database that includes a larger set of \ncountries than would be otherwise possible  \n \nData quality \n \nLike for poverty rates, estimates of annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption \nare based on income or consumption data collected in household surveys. The same quality issues \napplying to poverty rates apply here. Specifically, measuring household living standards has its own \ncomplications. Surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be \ncarefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is difficult to measure accurately, and consumption \ncomes closer to the notion of living standards. Moreover, income can vary over time even if living \nstandards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use \nconsumption for about two-thirds of countries. \n \nSimilar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing, sampling frames, or the \nquality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also \npose problems because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket \ngoods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly \nimportant in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure, but \nin practice are often not. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own \nproduction, but valuation methods vary. \n \nThe statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income data. \nAnalysis of some 20 countries for which both consumption and income data were available from the \nsame surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality. When \npoverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled \neach other out: there was no significant statistical difference.  \n \nInvariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or \nbecause nobody is at home during the interview visit. This is referred to as \u201cunit nonresponse\u201d and is \ndistinct from \u201citem nonresponse,\u201d which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but \nrefuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to income or consumption. To the extent \nthat survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the \nsample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes may \nnot be equally likely to respond. Richer households may be less likely to participate because of the high \nopportunity cost of their time or because of privacy concerns. It is conceivable that the poorest can \nlikewise be underrepresented; some are homeless or nomadic and hard to reach in standard household \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: September 2020 \n\nsurvey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less likely to be interviewed. This \ncan bias both poverty and inequality measurement if not corrected for. \n \n"

For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can \nlead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in male-dominated occupations, and \nlower their income-generating capacity. \n \nConcepts: \nOn  the  basis  of  the  International  Classification  of  Crime  for  Statistical  Purposes  (ICCS),  an  operational \ndefinition of physical and sexual harassment was developed.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThe indicator (commonly known as the Rural Access Index or RAI) measures the share of a country\u2019s rural \npopulation that lives within 2 km of an all-season road.  \n \nRationale: \nAmong other factors, transport connectivity is an essential part of the enabling environment for inclusive \nand sustained growth. In developing countries, particularly in Africa, the vast majority of agricultural \nproduction remains smallholder farming with limited access to local, regional, or global markets. Isolated \nmanufacturing and other local businesses (except for those related to mining) often lag behind in the \nglobal market. Limited transport connectivity is also a critical constraint to accessing social and \nadministrative services, especially in rural areas where the majority of the poor live.  \n \nRural access is key to unleashing untapped economic potential and eradicating poverty in many \ndeveloping countries. In the short term, transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road \nconditions. Over the longer term, agricultural productivity will be increased, and firms will become more \nprofitable with the creation of more jobs, eventually helping to alleviate poverty.  \n \nTo make good investments, quality data are required. Since resources are limited, it is essential to \nunderstand where the most critical unmet needs exist, and monitor efforts made over time. In the \ntransport sector, there are few global indicators. The quality of roads is often unknown and a matter of \nconcern in developing countries. In Africa, the Road Management Initiative, started by the Africa \nTransport Policy Program in the late 1990s, developed a road sector database, which includes road \nnetwork condition data such as the share of roads in good or bad condition. But this database is largely \noutdated and insufficient.  \n \nThe Rural Access Index (RAI), originally developed by the World Bank in 2006, is among the most \nimportant global development indicators in the transport sector, providing a strong, clearly \nunderstandable and conceptually consistent indicator across countries. It measures the proportion of \npeople living in rural areas who have access to an all-season road within a walking distance of \napproximately 2 kilometres (km). Although the underlying methodology has been updated to leverage \n\n\fLast updated: September 2020 \n \n\nadditional sources of data, the RAI remains the most widely accepted metric for tracking access to \ntransport in rural areas.  \n \nThe RAI has four primary benefits: sustainability due to its reliance on already existing data, consistency \nin methodology across countries and time, simplicity in understanding, and operational relevance for the \ngovernment agencies responsible for generating and aggregating the underlying data.  \n \nConcepts:  \nThe indicator is measured by combining three sets of geospatial data: where people live, the spatial \ndistribution of the road network, and road passability. The use of spatial data has various advantages. It \ncan help ensure consistency across countries. The level of spatial resolution is broadly the same \nregardless of the size of the country or subnational boundaries. Any given norm of connectivity (for \nexample, 2 km distance from a road) is uniquely and unambiguously applied for all countries.  \n \nPopulation Distribution - Quality population distribution data are essential for correct measurement of \nrural access. In some countries, census data is available in a geospatially detailed, reliable format. For \nother countries, population distribution data sets have been developed by the international research \ncommunity, interpreting subnational census data through various modelling techniques. For the RAI, \nWorldPop data has been found to provide a reliable estimate. That estimate can also be refined through \nengagement between the national statistics offices and WorldPop to reconcile data at the level of \nenumeration areas. \n \nRural-Urban Definition \u2013 Related to population distribution data, an important challenge facing the index \nis the need for a consistent and reliable urban and rural definition to exclude urban areas from the \ncalculation. The inclusion of urban areas would create a substantial upward bias in the RAI, because most \nurban residents have \u201caccess to roads,\u201d no matter how it is defined. Ideally, spatial data determining \nurban-rural boundaries are needed at a similar level of resolution as the population. As such data may \nrely on different definitions in different countries, globally produced urban extents may be used, such as \nthe Global Urban Rural Mapping Project v1 Urban Extent Polygons. \n \nRoad Network Data \u2013 Data on road locations may come from a number of sources. Ideally government \ndata are used, as they are consistent with the road network for which road agencies are responsible and \nare relatively easily merged with other operational databases. In countries where the road location data \nmay not be detailed enough or entirely missing or where there is a large unclassified network, alternative \ndata sources may be available, such as the open source OpenStreetMap.  \n \nRoad Condition Data \u2013 The principle of the \u201call-season\u201d road network remains central to the original \nconcept of measuring the RAI.  An \u201call-season road\u201d is defined as a road that is motorable all year round \nby the prevailing means of rural transport (often a pick-up or a truck which does not have four-wheel-\ndrive). Predictable interruptions of short duration during inclement weather (e.g. heavy rainfall) are \naccepted, particularly on low volume roads. A road that it is likely to be impassable to the prevailing \nmeans of rural transport for a total of 7 days or more per year is not regarded as all-season. Note that \nsome roads agencies use the term \u201call-weather\u201d to describe their roads, however \u201call-weather\u201d typically \nmeans \u201cpaved\u201d and should not be confused with \u201call-season\u201d which can include unpaved roads too. \n \nIt is important to determine whether access to facilities and services is available all year round, and hence \nthe possibility of the road throughout the year is an essential factor in this aspect of contributing to \n\n\fLast updated: September 2020 \n \n\npoverty reduction. Information on the condition of the road network is frequently maintained by road \nagencies as part of their operational responsibilities.  \n \nThe traditional road inventory survey can collect data on road condition, including the International \nRoughness Index (IRI), at a high level of information quality, to determine whether a road is \u201call-season\u201d. \nFor the purpose of the RAI, the road condition threshold is generally set at an IRI of less than 6 \nmeters/km for paved roads, and an IRI of less than 13 meters/km for unpaved roads. When IRI is not \navailable, other types of condition assessment may be used if comparable.  The use of smartphones with \nGPS are being investigated in order to accurately map local transport services routes, and identify which \nrural roads are open all year and hence are all-season roads. These condition thresholds should only be \nused, however, where there is reliable road condition data available. The parameters should be \ncalibrated to the local conditions, i.e. checks should be made to determine that paved roads in poor \ncondition are largely not all-season, and that unpaved roads in fair or poor condition are largely not all-\nseason. The parameters can be adjusted accordingly to the local conditions, based on a systematic and \ndocumented study. \n\nIn the event that accurate road condition data is not available, then accessibility factors provide an \nalternative means to road condition for identifying \u201call-season\u201d roads. Such factors do not require ground \nmeasurements of road condition to be made. Accessibility factors are those which determine the \nlikelihood of a road being all-season, or the risk of a road being inaccessible. \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe Indicator relies substantially on data collected by road agencies and national statistics offices for \ntheir operational work. As such, its update is dependent on the frequency of update of the road condition \nsurveys and national census. When these data sets are not from the same year, the basic principle to be \nfollowed is that a more stable data set should be used with more flexibility. For instance, a national rural \nroads program could dramatically improve the quality of roads in a certain locality in a relatively short \nterm, while population data are fairly stable over five years. In such a case, the road quality data would \nbe considered as an anchor, with the closest or adjusted population data applied. \n \nThe Indicator depends heavily on the quality and extent of the underlying spatial data. The extent of the \nroad network data, and how well it reflects the reality on the ground, can be a particular issue. \nVerification against open source data and satellite data where possible is recommended. More data are \nalways better. Efforts should also be made to collect detailed road data, including on tertiary or feeder \nroads, which may not be covered in the existing spatial road network data regardless of whether \ngovernment or open data sources are used. If condition data is not available, then use of accessibility \nfactors can be considered. \n \nThe 2 km norm of access may not be as applicable in all areas. In extremely mountainous countries, there \nhas been significant research into walking times and preparation of accessibility maps that take into \naccount mountainous terrain, locations of rivers and footbridges. However, for global consistency \npurposes and comparability across countries, the 2 km distance threshold has been maintained \n(equivalent to a 20-30 minute walk in most regions). \n \nWhile the RAI provides an objective benchmark for assessing access to transport in rural areas, \n\u201cuniversal\u201d road access of 100% should not be set as a target.  First mile or last mile connectivity is not \nintended to imply all-season road access. Connectivity can be a system of engineered trails and \n\n\fLast updated: September 2020 \n \n\nfootbridges as in Nepal, or designated river navigation channels and jetties as in Bangladesh, or a system \nof solar lit beacons and marked desert trails in Sudan. There are many more such examples:  most rural \nsettlements in the Amazon, Orinoco, Congo and Upper Nile River basins, have no or limited hinterland \nroad access.  The outer islands of the archipelagos of Indonesia and Philippines and South Pacific Islands \nrely heavily on coastal shipping. Similarly, vast regions of Siberia, the Russian steppes and Mongolia \ndepend on rail. The deltas of Mekong, the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Indus rely on water transport. It is \nsimply not possible, nor desirable, to address last mile connectivity by all-season rural roads in many \nsituations. In addition, in South Asia and growingly in Africa, motorcycles and autorickshaws are the \nmainstay of personal mobility and account for a growing share of rural commerce. \u201cAll-season\u201d for \nmotorcycles and autorickshaws is not the same as \u201call-season\u201d for 4-wheeled vehicles. And in the not too \ndistant future, self-driving all-terrain vehicles, or drones, could provide an important transport service. As \na global benchmark, however, the RAI should be considered as a starting point to begin discussions of all \nseason access.  \n \n"

This indicator is readily available and published on a quarterly basis by the World Bank in the \nRemittance Prices Worldwide database, which covers 365 country corridors, from 48 sending to 105 \nreceiving countries. The second component is to eliminate corridor where cost is 5% or higher. This \nshould be intended in the sense that it should be possible for remittance senders to send money to the \nbeneficiary for an average cost of 5% or less of the amount sent. For this purpose, it should suffice that in \neach corridor there are at least 3 services, meeting a defined set of service requirements (including \nservice quality, reach etc.), for which the average is 5% or less. \n \nRationale: \nData for these indicators have been collected by the World Bank through the Remittance Prices \nWorldwide (RPW) database since 2008 for the purpose of monitoring the G8 / G20 target on reducing \nremittance prices.

To achieve this objective, the governments in both sending and receiving countries should consider \nimplementing reforms based upon the General Principles for International Remittances Services by the \nWorld Bank/Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed \nframework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances and guiding actions to enhance \nthe efficiency of international remittances.

RPW was launched by the World Bank in \nSeptember 2008, and is a key tool in monitoring the evolution of costs to the remitters and the \nbeneficiaries from sending and receiving money in major country corridors. \n \nConcepts: \nInternational remittance transfer. A cross-border person-to-person payment of relatively low value. The \ntransfers are typically recurrent payments by migrant workers (who send money to their families in their \nhome country every month).

Nevertheless, the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is an important indicator in itself \nas a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, \nreduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThe question measures the feeling of fear of crime in a context outside the house and refers to the \nimmediate experience of this fear by the respondent by limiting the area in question to the \n\u201cneighbourhood\u201d or \u201cyour area\u201d (various formulations depending on cultural, physical and language \ncontext). \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nWhile the measurement of fear of crime is widely applied in crime victimization surveys around the \nworld, different practices exist in the operationalization of this indicator \u2013 for example, by not requiring \nthe person to \u201cwalk alone\u201d or limiting the walking to \u201cat night\u201d. Further guidance on measuring the \nindicator are currently elaborated by UNODC in collaboration with victimization survey experts. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nIn 2010 UNODC-UNECE published a Manual on Victimization Surveys that provides technical guidance on \nthe implementation of such surveys, on the basis of good practices developed at country level.

The JMP developed the metric of use \nof \u2018improved\u2019 sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human \ncontact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International \nconsultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the \nshortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water \nincluding accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes \nshould be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health \nhazards. \n \nThe above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond \nthe basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including \ndimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of \nfaecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and \nseptic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or the transport and treatment of wastes at a designated \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\ntreatment site. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the \nInternational Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, \nsecondary and tertiary treatment). \n \nHandwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In \n2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that \nthe most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household \nsurveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the \npresence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether \nhouseholds have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by \nsurvey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing \nbehaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour. \n \nConcepts: \n \nImproved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic \ntanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets. \n \nSafely disposed in situ; when pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain \nisolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG \nindicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a \ncommon practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services. \n \nTreated offsite; not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from \npit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment site. For instance, a portion may leak \nfrom the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. \nSimilarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to \nopen ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once \nthe excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment \nequipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of \nSDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will initially be assessed based on the reported level of \ntreatment. \n \nA handwashing facility with soap and water: a handwashing facility is a device to contain, transport or \nregulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing. This indicator is a proxy of actual handwashing \npractice, which has been found to be more accurate than other proxies such as self-reports of \nhandwashing practices. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nA framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 \ncountries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within \nthe sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and 6.3.1. Data on safe \ndisposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to \nmake global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 29 September 2017 \n\nPresence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that household members \nconsistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy.

Indicator 5.5.1(b) measures the degree to which \ngender balance has been achieved in, and women have equal access to, political decision-making in local \ngovernment.  \n \nIndicator 5.5.1(b) complements the Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for \nthe representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have \nthe potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are \ncovered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government.  \n \nConcepts:  \nLocal government is one of the sub-national spheres of government and a result of decentralization, a \nprocess of transferring political, fiscal, and administrative powers from the central government to sub-\nnational units of government distributed across the territory of a country to regulate and/or run certain \ngovernment functions or public services on their own.  \n \nThe definition of local government follows the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA) distinction between \ncentral, state, and local government (para 4.129). Local government consists of local government units, \ndefined in the SNA as \u201cinstitutional units whose fiscal, legislative and executive authority extends over the \nsmallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes\u201d (para 4.145). What \nconstitutes local government of a given country is defined by that country\u2019s national legal framework, \nincluding national constitutions and local government acts or equivalent legislation. \n \n\n1 \n\n \n\n Each local government unit typically includes a legislative/ deliberative body and an executive body. \nLegislative/ deliberative bodies, such as councils or assemblies, are formal entities with a prescribed number \nof members as per national or state legislation. They are usually elected by universal suffrage and have \ndecision-making power, including the ability to issue by-laws, on a range of local aspects of public affairs.  \n \nExecutive bodies, consisting of an executive committee or a mayor, may be elected, appointed or nominated \nand they prepare and execute decisions made by the legislative/ deliberative body.  \n \nElected positions are the most common manner of selection of local government members. They are selected \nin local elections, based on a system of choosing political office holders in which the voters cast ballots for \nthe person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The category of elected positions \nincludes both elected persons who competed on openly contested seats and persons selected during the \nelectoral processes on reserved seats or through a candidate quota. \n \nBy comparison, members selected on appointed positions (the least common manner of selection of local \ngovernment members) are nominated, typically by government officials from higher-ranking tiers of \ngovernment. Appointed members of local government are more frequent among the leadership positions, \nsuch as the heads of the executive body, representatives of specific groups (e.g., women, disadvantaged \ngroups, youth); and, temporary committees/delegations/caretakers appointed by government officials when \na council has been dissolved. \n \nComments and limitations: \nIndicator 5.5.1(b) refers to the representation of women among elected positions of legislative/deliberative \nbodies of local government. This is a strength, because it ensures comparability across countries, at low cost, \nand mirrors the SDG indicator measuring women\u2019s representation at national level, in parliament. This is also \na limitation in that the indicator does not consider other positions in local government. Local government \nofficials holding executive positions who are not simultaneously holding a position within the \nlegislative/deliberative body, or who are appointed and not elected, are not considered in this indicator.  \n \nIt is recommended that women\u2019s representation in executive positions, particularly at the level of the head of \nthe executive (such as mayor), is monitored separately at national and global levels, but not as a headline \nSDG indicator. \n \nImportantly, the indicator refers to representation among members of local government and not the quality \nof their participation. Countries may therefore consider assessing political participation through national or \nsubnational studies involving qualitative and/or quantitative methods of research. Additional indicators of \npolitical participation may also be monitored at national level, such as women\u2019s share among voters and \ncandidates in local elections, to monitor the closing of other gaps on women\u2019s political participation.   \n \nFinally, aspects of local governance beyond the formal institutions of local government, such as public \nadministration staff, are not included in the indicator 5.5.1(b), and may be covered by other indicators in the \nSDG framework, particularly within the Goal 16 on inclusive societies. \n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n "

These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when \nlooking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential \ntreatment that set criteria for eligibility. \n \nA full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for the computation, but \npreferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries' exporters for different reasons \nsuch as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin).

Security from violence is a pre-\nrequisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. \nIntentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. \n \nMonitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences \nand, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as \nsuggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: \ninter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other \nforms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime). \n \nConcepts: \n \nIn the ICCS intentional homicide is defined as the \u2018\u2018Unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent \nto cause death or serious injury\u201d. This definition contains three elements characterizing the killing of a \nperson as intentional homicide: \n1. The killing of a person by another person (objective element); \n2. The intent of the perpetrator to kill or seriously injure the victim (subjective element); \n3. The unlawfulness of the killing, which means that the law considers the perpetrator liable for the \nunlawful death (legal element). \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nThis definition states that, for statistical purposes, all killings corresponding to the three criteria above \nshould be considered as intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national \nlegislations or practices. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states \nthat the following killings are included in the count of homicide: \n- Murder \n- Honour killing \n- Serious assault leading to death \n- Death as a result of terrorist activities \n- Dowry-related killings \n- Femicide \n- Infanticide \n- Voluntary manslaughter \n- Extrajudicial killings \n- Killings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials \n \nFurthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings \ndirectly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes. \n \nThe fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national \nlevel (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of \nthe two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both \nsources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on \nHomicide, 2013). \n \nData on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of \ndiseases (ICD-10), which provides a definition of \u2018Death by assault\u2019 that is very close to the definition of \nintentional homicide of the ICCS. \n \n"

For instance, \nPRESS numbers rely on the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for ODA commitments supplemented by \nvoluntary reporting from additional donors. Yet, full coverage of all programs cannot be guaranteed. \nFurthermore, the reported commitments can be seen as an upper bound to the actual support to \nstatistics for mainly three reasons. First, double counting of projects may occur when the donor and \nproject implementer report on the same project or when all project co-financers report project totals. \nSecond, the reported numbers may be inflated by working with project totals for multi-sector projects, \nwhich comprise only a small statistics component.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThis indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self-report that they personally \nexperienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by \ninternational human rights law. International human rights law refers to the body of international legal \ninstruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations. \n \nRationale: \nThe pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the centre of the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development. The elimination of discrimination is also enshrined in the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights and the core international human rights treaties. The purpose of this indicator is to \nmeasure a prevalence of discrimination based on the personal experience reported by individuals.  It is \nconsidered an outcome indicator (see HR/PUB/12/5) helping to measure the effectiveness of non-\ndiscriminatory laws, policy and practices for the concerned population groups. \n \nConcepts: \nDiscrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that \nis directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or \neffect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public \nlife.1  Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of \ndiscrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, \n                                                           \n1 See, for instance, Art. 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \nDiscrimination (ICERD); Art. 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \nWomen (CEDAW); Art. 2 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD); General \nComment 18 of the Human Rights Committee (paragraphs 6 and 7) and General Comment 20 of the \nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (paragraph 7). \n\n abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, \nhostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take \nthe form of a single incident.2 \n\n \n\nInternational human rights law provides lists of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. The inclusion of \n\u201cother status\u201d in these lists indicate that they are not exhaustive and that other grounds may be \nrecognized by international human rights mechanisms. A review of the international human rights \nnormative framework helps identify a list of grounds that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, \npolitical or other opinion, national origin, social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, \nmarital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, place of residence, economic \nand social situation, pregnancy, indigenous status, afro-descent and other status.3 In practice, it will be \ndifficult to include all potentially relevant grounds of discrimination in household survey questions. For \nthis reason, it is recommended that data collectors identify contextually relevant and feasible lists of \ngrounds, drawing on the illustrative list and formulation of prohibited grounds of discrimination outlined \nin the methodology section below, and add an \u201cother\u201d category to reflect other grounds that may not \nhave been listed explicitly. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nThe indicator measures an overall population prevalence of discrimination and harassment in the total \npopulation at the national level. The indicator will not necessarily inform on the prevalence of \ndiscrimination within specific population groups. This will depend on sample frames. For example, if \ndisability is included within the selected grounds, the resulting data for discrimination on the ground of \ndisability will represent only the proportion of the total population who feel that they had personally \nexperienced discrimination against on the ground of disability. Unless the sample design provides \nadequate coverage of people with disability to allow disaggregation on this characteristic, the data \ncannot be understood as an indication of the prevalence of discrimination (on the ground of disability) \nwithin the population of people with a disability. \n \nThe indicator is not measuring a general perception of respondents on the overall prevalence of \ndiscrimination in a country. It is based on personal experience self-reported by individual respondents. \nThe indicator does not provide a legal determination of any alleged or proven cases of discrimination. The \nindicator will also not capture the cases of discrimination or harassment the respondents are not \npersonally aware off or willing to disclose to data collectors. The indicator should be a starting point for \nfurther efforts to understand patterns of discrimination and harassment (e.g. location/context of \nincidents, relationship of the respondent to the person or entity responsible for discrimination or \nharassment, and frequency and severity of incidents). More survey questions will be needed for \nexamining policy and legislative impact and responses. \n \n\n                                                           \n2 See, for instance, General Comment 20 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and United \nNations Secretary-General\u2019s  bulletin (ST/SGB/2008/5) on Prohibition of discrimination, harassment, including \nsexual harassment, and abuse of authority. \n\n3 More information on the grounds of discrimination prohibited by international human rights law is available \nat: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/HRIndicators/HumanRightsStandards.pdf  OHCHR advises that data collectors engage in participatory processes to identify contextually relevant \ngrounds and formulations. The process should be guided by the principles outlined in OHCHR\u2019s Human \nRights-Based Approaches to Data (HRBAD), which stems from internationally agreed human rights and \nstatistics standards. National Institutions with mandates related to human rights or non-discrimination \nand equality are ideal partners for these activities. Data collectors are also strongly encouraged to work \nwith civil society organisations that are the representatives of or have better access to groups more are \nrisk of being discriminated or left behind.  \n\n \n"

It is globally relevant as violence in various forms occurs in all regions and \ncountries of the world. Given that acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this \nindicator needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the adult population. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThis indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical, psychological or sexual violence \n \nPhysical violence: This concept is equivalent to the concept of physical assault, as defined in the \nInternational Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS): the intentional or reckless application \nof physical force inflicted upon the body of a person. This includes serious and minor bodily injuries and \nserious and minor physical force. According to the ICCS, these are defined as: \n \nSerious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed \nlimbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe \nor critical injuries. \n \nSerious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown \nobject; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury. \n \nMinor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and \nother minor injuries. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nMinor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other \napplications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury. \n \nSexual violence (ICCS): Unwanted sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or contact or communication \nwith unwanted sexual attention without valid consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, \nfraud, coercion, threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position of \nvulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault. \n \nPsychological violence: There is as yet no consensus at the international level of the precise definition of \npsychological violence and there is as yet no generally well-established methodology to measure \npsychological violence. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nCrime victimization surveys are able to capture experience of violence suffered by adult population of \nboth sexes; however, due to the complexity of collecting information on experiences of violence, it is \nlikely that not all experiences of violence are duly covered by these surveys, which aim to cover several \ntypes of crime experience. Other dedicated surveys on violence usually focus on selected population \ngroups (typically women, children or the elderly) or in specific contexts (domestic violence, schools, \nprisons, etc.), but they are not able to portray levels and trends of violence in the entire population. \n \nWhile there are already international standards on measuring physical and sexual violence through \nsurvey instruments, there is currently no international standard on the measurement of psychological \nviolence. One practical option could be to limit psychological violence to threatening behaviour, which \ndoes have an established methodology of measurement in victimization surveys. Threatening behaviour, \nat minimum, is an intentional behaviour that causes fear of injury or harm. \n \nFinally, indicators on prevalence of physical and sexual violence are usually produced and reported \nseparately; the production of data on the prevalence of physical or sexual violence requires ad-hoc data \ncollection. \n \nVictimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household surveys) are usually restricted to \nthe general population living in households above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age), while \nsometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of age). \n \n"

The severity of food insecurity, \ndefined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a \nmeasurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience \nScale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014. \n \nConcepts: Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in \na series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic \ncontexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the need to \ncompromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of \nfood by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not \nhaving means to access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an \nexperience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods \nrooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute \ntheoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The \nseverity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of \nhouseholds\u2019 or individuals\u2019 inability to regularly access the food they need. \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThis  indicator  is  defined  as  the  total  count  of  conflict-related  deaths  divided  by  the  total  population, \nexpressed per 100,000 population. \n \n\u2018Conflict\u2019  is  defined  as  \u2018armed  conflict\u2019  in  reference  to  a  terminology  enshrined  in  International \nHumanitarian Law (IHL), and applied to situations based on the assessment of the United Nations (UN) and \nother  internationally  mandated  entities.    \u2018Conflict-related  deaths\u2019  refers  to  direct  and  indirect  deaths \nassociated to armed conflict.  \u2018Population\u2019 refers to total resident population in a given situation of armed \nconflict  included  in  the  indicator,  in  a  given  year.  Population  data  are  derived  from  annual  estimates \nproduced by the UN Population Division. \n \n Rationale: \nThis indicator measures the prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact in terms of loss of life.  Together \nwith the indicator 16.1.1 on intentional homicide, they measure violent deaths that occur in all countries \nof the world (intentional homicides) and in situations of armed conflict (conflict-related deaths).  \n \nThe  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  seeks  to  strengthen  universal  peace  and  commits  to \nredouble efforts to resolve or prevent conflict. It recognizes that there can be no sustainable development \nwithout peace and no peace without sustainable development.  Counting deaths occurring in situations of \narmed conflict is therefore essential to the measurement of the Agenda, including and beyond its Goal 16. \nMonitoring conflict-related deaths is also necessary to help protect civilians and other potential victims, \nensure  respect  of  humanitarian  and  human  rights  standards,  and  understand  the  patterns  and \nconsequences of armed conflicts in order to prevent future armed conflicts. \n \n \n \nConcepts: \n\u2018Conflict\u2019 \nAccording to IHL, the branch of international law, which specifically focuses on armed conflicts, two types \nof armed conflicts exist: international armed conflicts (IAC) and non-international armed conflicts (NIAC).  \n IAC exist whenever there is resort to armed force between two or more States. An IAC does not exist in \ncases in which use of force is the result of an error (e.g. involuntary incursion into foreign territory, wrongly \nidentifying the target); and when the territorial State has given its consent to an intervention.  \n \nNIAC are protracted armed confrontations occurring between governmental armed forces and the forces \nof  one  or  more  armed  groups,  or  between  such  groups  arising  on  the  territory  of  a  State.  The  armed \nconfrontation must reach a \u201cminimum level of intensity\u201d and the parties involved in the conflict must show \na \u201cminimum of organisation\u201d.   \n \n\u2018Conflict-related deaths\u2019 \nDirect deaths are deaths where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from \nwar operations and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance \nof or under the guise of armed conflict.  \n \nThese deaths may have been caused by (i) the use of weapons or (ii) other means and methods.  Deaths \ncaused by the use of weapons, include but are not limited to those inflicted by firearms, missiles, mines, \nand bladed weapons. It may also include deaths resulting from aerial attacks and bombardments (e.g. of \nmilitary bases, cities and villages), crossfire, explosive remnants of war, targeted killings or assassinations, \nforce protection incidents. Deaths caused by other means and methods may include deaths from torture \nor sexual and gender-based violence, intentional killing using starvation, depriving prisoners of access to \nhealth care or denying access to essential goods and services  (e.g. an ambulance stopped at a check point). \n \nIndirect deaths are deaths resulting from a loss of access to essential goods and services (e.g. economic \nslowdown, shortages of medicines or reduced farming capacity that result in lack of access to adequate \nfood,  water,  sanitation,  health  care  and  safe  conditions  of  work)  that  are  caused  or  aggravated  by  the \nsituation of armed conflict. \n \nBy  definition,  these  deaths  should  be  separated  from  other  violent  deaths  which  are,  in  principle,  not \nconnected to the situation of armed conflict (e.g. intentional and non-intentional homicides, self-defence, \nself-inflicted),  but  are  still  relevant  to  the  implementation  and  measurement  of  SDG  target  16.1.  The \nInternational  Classification  of  Crime  for  Statistical  Purposes  (ICCS)  provides  definitional  elements  and \nclassification of violent deaths both related and not related to armed conflict.  The ICCS provides indications \non how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/armed conflict and \nkillings that amount to war crimes. \n \n\u2018Cause\u2019 refers to the weapons, means and methods that caused the conflict-related deaths.  The categories \nfor the disaggregation of the \u2018cause of death\u2019 for direct deaths build on the WHO International Classification \nof  Diseases  (ICD-11),  ICCS,  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  (ICRC)  overview  of  weapons \nregulated by IHL, UN practice and OHCHR casualty recording.   \n \n \nComments and limitations: \nIn situations of armed conflict, a large share of deaths may not be reported.  Often, normal registration \nsystems are heavily affected by the presence of armed conflict. Additionally, actors on both sides of an \narmed conflict may have incentives for misreporting, deflating or inflating casualties. In most instances, the \nnumber of cases reported will depend on access to conflict zones, access to information, motivation and \nperseverance  of  both  international  and  national  actors,  such  as  UN  peace  missions  and  other internationally  mandated  entities,  national  institutions  (e.g.  national  statistical  offices,  national  human \nrights institutions) and relevant civil society organizations.   \n \n"

Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when \nadministrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, \nits negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and \njustice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective \nmetric of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption \n \nConcepts: \n \nIn the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), bribery is defined as: \u2018Promising, \noffering, giving, soliciting, or accepting an undue advantage to or from a public official or a person who \ndirects or works in a private sector entity, directly or indirectly, in order that the person act or refrain \nfrom acting in the exercise of his or her official duties\u2019. This definition is based on definitions of bribery of \nnational public officials, bribery of foreign public officials and official of international organisations and \nbribery in the private sector that are contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption \n(articles 15, 16, and 21). \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nWhile the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such as promising or offering, and it \ncovers both public and private sector, this indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more \nmeasurable (the giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public sector. \n \nThe concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of money, gifts or provision of a \nservice requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment. \n \nThis indicator captures the often called \u2018administrative bribery\u2019, which is often intended as the type of \nbribery affecting citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants. \n \nFor this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a legislative, executive, administrative or \njudicial office. In the operationalization of the indicator, a list of selected officials and civil servants is \nused. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nIn the experience of several surveys conducted at national and international level, the so-called bribery \nprevalence rate is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official \nmoney, a gift or counter favour) to a public official in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who \nhad at least one contact with a public official in the same period. In this formulation the share of \npopulation who was asked a bribe but did not give it is not included. Available data at national and \ninternational level usually refers to this formulation, while the collection of data according to the \nformulation included in the SDG framework will depend on the adaptation of relevant survey tools and \nthe calculation by national authorities. It is expected that data according to the current definition will \nbecome available gradually. \n \nOn a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides solid information on the \nexperience of bribery occurring in the interaction between citizens and the public sector in the context of \nservice delivery/transactions, while it does not cover other forms of corruption, such as \u00b4grand \ncorruption\u00b4, trading in influence or abuse of power \n \n"

This selection of data is based on the \ncurrently  available  sources  and  can  provide  some  insight  into  the  safety  or  otherwise  of  routes.  Not \nincluded  in  the  data  collection  is  information  about  migrants  who  die,  or  go  missing,  in  countries  of \ndestination or residence. Deaths in refugee housing, immigration detention centres or camps are excluded. \nThe  MMP  data  also  exclude  deaths  that  occur  during  deportation or  after  forced  return  to  a  migrant\u2019s \nhomeland or third country, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants\u2019 precarious or irregular \nstatus, such as those resulting from labour exploitation or resulting from lack of access to health care.  \n\nRationale: \nThe research behind the MMP began with the October 2013 tragedies, when at least 368 individuals died \nin two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. The MMP data aims to bear witness to the global \nphenomenon of migrant deaths, and is the only global database on this topic. It is hoped that by counting \nand  accounting  for  these  deaths,  almost  all  of  which  are  linked  to  irregular  migration,  policymakers, \nacademics, and the general public will be better informed about the risks linked to unsafe migration.  \n\nGiven that there are few official sources of data on deaths during migration, these data are best understood \nas a minimum estimate of the true number of migrant deaths worldwide. The MMP collects data from a \nvariety  of  sources, which  change  over  time  given  the  large  geography  covered  and  the  politicization of \nirregular migration \u2013 notably the criminalization of search and rescue actors in the Mediterranean and US-\nMexico  border  \u2013  which  affect  access  to  relevant  information.  With  this  in  mind,  these  data  are  best \nunderstood as indicative of the global nature of migrant fatalities, and should not be used to identify trends \nover time outside of the US-Mexico border, where official data is more frequently available compared to \nother areas of the world.  \n\nConcepts: \nMigrant - An umbrella term, not defined under international law, reflecting the common lay understanding \nof a person who moves away from his or her place of usual residence, whether within a country or across \nan  international  border,  temporarily  or  permanently,  and  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  The  term  includes  a \nnumber of well-defined legal categories of people, such as migrant workers; persons whose particular types \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: March 2021 \n\nof movements are legally-defined, such as smuggled migrants; as well as those whose status or means of \nmovement are not specifically defined under international law, such as international students. \n\nIrregular migration - Movement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international \nagreements governing the entry into or exit from the State of origin, transit or destination. \n\nComments and limitations: \nThe MMP database provides a global overview of data on migrant fatalities, but it is primarily dependent \non secondary sources of information. Information is gathered from diverse sources such as official \nrecords \u2013 including from coast guards and medical examiners \u2013 and other sources such as media reports, \nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs), and surveys and interviews of migrants. The reliability and \ncompleteness of data vary greatly from region to region, from country to country and over time. Table 1, \nin the methodology section below, illustrates the wide variety of sources used in the MMP database, and \ngives some insight into the various advantages and disadvantages of each. For example, some of the data \nare collected directly from migrants, either from survivors or through an increasing number of surveys of \nmigrants. However, data from surveys and/or eyewitness testimonies may not be representative, and \nthere may be a risk of double-counting if migrants report the same incident when asked whether they are \naware of a migrant death or disappearance. \n \n"

There is \nno proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure.  All daily and non-daily users of \ntobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing \nthe prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality \nfrom NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate \nmonitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on \nTobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the \nWHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of \nSDG Target 3.a \u201cStrengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework \nConvention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate\u201d. \n \nConcepts: \nTobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products.  \u201cCurrent use\u201d means use within \nthe previous 30 days at the time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use. \n \nTobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf tobacco as raw material intended \nfor human consumption through smoking, sucking, chewing or sniffing.  \n \n\u201cSmoked tobacco products\u201d include cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water \npipes), roll-your-own tobacco, kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking. \n \n\"Smokeless tobacco product\" includes moist snuff, creamy snuff, dry snuff, plug, dissolvables, gul, loose \nleaf, red tooth powder, snus, chimo, gutkha, khaini, gudakhu, zarda, quiwam, dohra, tuibur, nasway, \nnaas, naswar, shammah, toombak, paan (betel quid with tobacco), iq\u2019mik, mishri, tapkeer, tombol and \nany other tobacco product that consumed by sniffing, holding in the mouth or chewing. \n \nPrevalence estimates have been \u201cage-standardized\u201d to make them comparable across all countries no \nmatter the demographic profile of the country. This is done by applying each country\u2019s age-and-sex \nspecific prevalence rates to the WHO Standard Population.  The resulting rates are hypothetical numbers \nwhich are only meaningful when comparing rates obtained for one country \nwith those obtained for another country. \n \n\n\fDate updated: November 2020 \n\n \nComments and limitations:   \nRaw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used \nto calculate comparable estimates for this indicator.  Information from subnational surveys are not used.  \n \nIn some countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries where \nother forms of tobacco are also being consumed, smoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to \nsome degree.   \n \nThe comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the \nestimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling \nand analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age \nranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different \ntobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country\u2019s perception \nof which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored \nsimultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of \ne-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries\u2019 definitions of tobacco use. The \ndefinition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, \nsurveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use.  \n \nThere is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use.  WHO\u2019s \nTobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve \ncomparability of indicators across countries. \n \n \n"

They contain the world\u2019s freshwater resources \nand can be defined as \u201ca dynamic complex of plant, animal, and micro-organism communities and the \nnon-living environment dominated by the presence of flowing or still water, interacting as a functional \nunit.\u201d (MEA, 2005; Dickens et al, 2019).  The indicator is framed around the monitoring of different types \nof water-related ecosystems including lakes, rivers, wetlands, groundwater and artificial waterbodies \nsuch as reservoirs. These water-related ecosystems contain freshwater, with the exception of mangroves \nwhich contain brackish water (i.e. a combination of fresh and saltwater) however mangroves are still \nincluded within indicator 6.6.1. Reservoirs are also included as a category of water-related ecosystem \nwithin the indicator methodology; while it is recognized that reservoirs are not traditional water \necosystems which should necessarily warrant protection and restoration, in many countries they hold a \nnoteworthy amount of freshwater and have thus been included. By including data on reservoirs, it is \nintended that countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction \nwith changes occurring to natural water bodies. Ecosystems that are not included under indicator 6.6.1 \nare: coral reefs and sea grass which are covered within Goal 14 (Oceans); and mountains, forests, and \ndrylands which are covered within Goal 15 (Land). The extent to which each of the water-related \necosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical \nparameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. The full monitoring \nmethodology for indicator 6.6.1 is available here. The extent to which each of the water-related \necosystems included under indicator 6.6.1 can be measured, uses one or more of the following physical \nparameters of change: spatial area, quantity (or volume) of water, and water quality. \n Inland vegetated wetlands include areas of marshes, peatlands, swamps, bogs and fens, the vegetated \nparts of floodplains as well as rice paddies and flood recession agriculture. Inland vegetated wetlands do \nnot include coastal mangroves. Data on mangroves which are produced separately to inland wetlands. \nThis SDG indicator methodology is used for official reporting of SDG indicator 6.6.1 statistics. The SDG \nindicator 6.6.1 methodology does not apply the definition of wetlands defined by the Ramsar Convention \non Wetlands, which is: \u201careas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent \nor temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water \nthe depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters\u201d. The Ramsar definition of wetlands may be \ninterpreted to mean all water within a country including the marine environment. The SDG indicator \n6.6.1 definition refers to only a specific group of inland vegetated wetlands typologies. \n \n\nPermanent and seasonal water. A permanent water surface is underwater throughout the year whilst a \nseasonal water surface is underwater for less than 12 months of the year. Some locations don\u2019t have \nobservations for all 12 months of the year (for reasons such as polar night). In these cases, water is \nconsidered as seasonal if the number of months where water is present is less than the number of months \nwhere valid observations were acquired. \nA second consideration is lakes and rivers that freeze for part of the year. During the frozen period water is \nstill present under the ice (true both for rivers/lakes and the sea). If water is present throughout the \nobservation period (i.e. unfrozen period), the water body is considered as a permanent water surface. If the \narea of the water body contracts during the unfrozen period, then the pixels along the borders of the lake or \nriver are no longer water, and those pixels will be considered as a seasonal water surface. \n \nReservoirs are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally \noccurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs \nformed  by  dams,  flooded  areas  such  as  opencast  mines  and  quarries,  flood  irrigation  areas,  and  water \nbodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction. \n\nTurbidity is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of \nunderwater light availability. \n\nTrophic State refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most \ncommonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication. \n\nSurface Water refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the \nfollowing 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies. \n\nExtent \u2013 has been expanded beyond spatial extent to capture additional basic parameters needed for the \nprotection  and restoration  of  water-related  ecosystems.  Extent  includes  three  components:  the  spatial \nextent or surface area, the quality, and the quantity of water-related ecosystems.  \n\nChange means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, \nmeasured against a point of reference. \n\nPermanent and seasonal water concept definitions and data resolution \n\nData on the spatial and temporal dynamics of naturally occurring surface water has been generated for the \nentire  globe.    A  Global  Surface  Water  dataset  (Pekel  et  al.,  2016)  has  been  produced  by  the  European \nCommission's Joint Research Centre. The dataset documents different facets of the long term (since 1984 \nonward) water dynamics at 30x30 meter pixel resolution. The dataset documents permanent and seasonal surface water surfaces. All naturally occurring surface water larger in area than 30x30 meters has been \nmapped and at this 30 meter grid/pixel spatial resolution satellite imagery is predominantly capturing areas \nof lakes and wide rivers (ie rivers over 30meters wide). The data include land areas that are temporarily \ninundated. Smaller rivers and waterbodies are not captured as they are too narrow to detect or are masked \nby forest canopy. The data include individual full-resolution images acquired by the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 and \nSentinel 1 satellites. These satellites capture images which are distributed publicly by the United States \nGeological  Survey  and  by  the  European  Union\u2019s  Copernicus  space  programme.  Together  they  provide \nmultispectral imagery at 30x30 meter resolution in six visible, near and shortwave infrared channels, plus \nthermal imagery at 60x60 meters.  \n\nThe data includes land surfaces that are under water (e.g. a permanent water area) for all twelve months \nof a year. It also accounts for seasonal and climactic fluctuations of water, meaning lakes and rivers which \nfreeze for part of the year are captured. Areas of permanent ice, such as glaciers and ice caps as well as \npermanently  snow-covered  land  areas  are  not  included.  Areas  of  consistent  cloud  cover  inhibit  the \nobservation of water surfaces in some areas and in these limited locations optical observations may not be \navailable. A global shoreline mask has been applied to the data to prevent ocean water being included in \nthe  freshwater  statistics  and  the  methodology  for  this  shoreline  mask  is  published  in  the  journal  of \noperational oceanography, available here (Sayer et al. 2019). \n\nThe  accuracy  of  the  Global Surface  Water  map  was  determined  using  over  40,000  control  points  from \naround the world and across the 36 years. The full validation methodology and results have been published \nin the scientific journal Nature, available here, (Pekel et al., 2016). The validation results show that the \nwater detection expert system produced less than 1% of false water detections, and that less than 5% of \nwater surfaces were missed. The provided maps are derived from the analysis of over four million images \ncollected over 36 years which have been individually processed using an accurate expert system classifier. \n\nThe SDG 6.6.1 data portal (www.sdg661.app) documents various water transitions relating to permanent \nand seasonal surface water - these are changes in water state between two points in time (e.g. 2000  - \n2019). Data is available for various transitions including new permanent water surfaces (i.e. conversion of \na  no  water  place  into  a  permanent  water  place.);  lost  permanent  water  surfaces  (i.e.  conversion  of  a \npermanent water place into a no water place) as well as new and lost seasonal water. These allow monthly \nwater presence or absence data to be captured. It is possible to identify specific months/years in which \nconditions changed, e.g. the date of filing of a new dam, or the month/year in which a lake disappeared. In \naddition,  data  on  seasonality  are  provided,  capturing  changes  resulting  from  intra  and  inter-annual \nvariability or resulting from appearance or disappearance of seasonal or permanent water surfaces. The \ndata separates 'permanent' water bodies (those that are present throughout the period of observation) \n[nominally a year] from 'seasonal' (those that are present for only part of the year). \n\n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \nThe national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line. \nThe rural poverty rate is the percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line (or \nin  cases  where  a  separate,  rural  poverty  line  is  used,  the  rural  poverty  line).  Urban  poverty  rate  is  the \npercentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate, \nurban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line).  \n \nRationale: \nMonitoring  national  poverty  is  important  for  country-specific  development  agendas.  National  poverty \nlines  are  used  to  make  more  accurate  estimates  of  poverty  consistent  with  the  country\u2019s  specific \neconomic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.  \n \nConcepts: \nIn assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according to national definitions, \none  naturally  focuses  on  a  poverty  line  that  is  considered  appropriate  for  that  country.  Poverty  lines \nacross countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such \nthat richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. Within a country, the \ncost  of  living  is  typically  higher  in  urban  areas  than  in  rural  areas.  Some  countries  may  have  separate \nurban and rural poverty lines to represent different purchasing powers.  \n \nComments and limitations: \nNational poverty estimates are derived from household survey data. Caveats and limitations inherent to \nsurvey data applying to the construction of indicator 1.1.1 apply here as well.   \n \nTo  be  useful  for  poverty  estimates,  surveys  must  be  nationally  representative.  They  must  also  include \nenough  information  to  compute  a  comprehensive  estimate  of  total  household  consumption  or  income \n(including  consumption  or  income  from  own  production)  and  to  construct  a  correctly  weighted \ndistribution of consumption or income per person. \n\n\fLast updated: 24 January 2017 \n \n\n \nConsumption  is  the  preferred  welfare  indicator  for  a  number  of  reasons1.  Income  is  generally  more \ndifficult to measure accurately. For example, the poor who work in the informal sector may not receive or \nreport  monetary  wages;  self-employed  workers  often  experience  irregular  income  flows;  and  many \npeople  in  rural  areas  depend  on  idiosyncratic,  agricultural  incomes.  Moreover,  consumption  accords \nbetter with the idea of the standard of living than income, which can vary over time even if the actual \nstandard of living does not. Thus, whenever possible, consumption-based welfare indicators are used to \nestimate  the  poverty  measures  reported  here.  But  consumption  data  are  not  always  available.  For \ninstance in Latin America and the Caribbean, the vast majority of countries collect primarily income data. \nIn those cases there is little choice but to use income data. \n\nConsumption  is  measured  by  using  household  survey  questions  on  food  and  nonfood  expenditures  as \nwell  as  food  consumed  from  the  household\u2019s  own  production,  which  is  particularly  important  in  the \npoorest developing countries. This information is collected either through recall questions using lists of \nconsumption  items  or  through  diaries  in  which  respondents  record  all  expenditures  daily.  But  these \nmethods  do  not  always  provide  equivalent  information,  and  depending  on  the  approach  used, \nconsumption can be underestimated or overestimated. Different surveys use different recall or reference \nperiods.  Depending  on  the  true  flow  of  expenditures,  the  rate  of  spending  reported  is  sensitive  to  the \nlength of reporting period. The longer the reference period, the more likely respondents will fail to recall \ncertain expenses\u2014especially food items\u2014thus resulting in underestimation of true expenditure. \n\nBest-practice  surveys  administer  detailed  lists  of  specific  consumption  items.  These  individual  items \ncollected through the questionnaires are aggregated afterwards. But many surveys use questionnaires in \nwhich  respondents  are  asked  to  report  expenditures  for  broad  categories  of  goods.  In  other  words, \nspecific consumption items are implicitly aggregated by virtue of the questionnaire design. This shortens \nthe  interview,  reducing  the  cost  of  the  survey.  A  shorter  questionnaire  is  also  thought  to  reduce  the \nlikelihood of fatigue for both respondents and interviewers, which can lead to reporting errors. However, \nthere  is  also  evidence  that  less  detailed  coverage  of  specific  items  in  the  questionnaire  can  lead  to \nunderestimation  of  actual  household  consumption.  The  reuse  of  questionnaires  may  cause  new \nconsumption goods to be omitted, leading to further underreporting. \n\nInvariably  some  sampled  households  do  not  participate  in  surveys  because  they  refuse  to  do  so  or \nbecause  nobody  is  at  home.  This  is  often  referred  to  as  \u201cunit  nonresponse\u201d  and  is  distinct  from  \u201citem \nnonresponse,\u201d  which  occurs  when  some  of  the  sampled  respondents  participate  but  refuse  to  answer \ncertain  questions,  such  as  those  pertaining  to  consumption  or  income.  To  the  extent  that  survey \nnonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will \nstill  be  representative  of  the  population.  However,  households  with  different  incomes  are  not  equally \nlikely  to  respond.  Relatively  rich  households  may  be  less  likely  to  participate  because  of  the  high \nopportunity cost of their time or because of concerns about intrusion in their affairs. It is conceivable that \nthe  poorest  can  likewise  be  underrepresented;  some  are  homeless  and  hard  to  reach  in  standard \nhousehold  survey  designs,  and  some  may  be  physically  or  socially  isolated  and  thus  less  easily \ninterviewed.  If  nonresponse  systematically  increases  with  income,  surveys  will  tend  to  overestimate \npoverty.  But  if  compliance  tends  to  be  lower  for  both  the  very  poor  and  the  very  rich,  there  will  be \npotentially offsetting effects on the measured incidence of poverty. \n\nEven  if  survey  data were entirely  accurate  and  comprehensive,  the  measure  of  poverty  obtained  could \nstill fail  to  capture  important  aspects  of  individual  welfare.  For  example,  using  household  consumption \nmeasures ignores potential inequalities within households. Thus, consumption- or income-based poverty \nmeasures are informative but should not be interpreted as a sufficient statistic for assessing the quality of \npeople\u2019s  lives.  The  national  poverty  rate,  a  \u201cheadcount\u201d  measure,  is  one  of  the  most  commonly \ncalculated  measures  of  poverty.  Yet  it  has  the  drawback  that  it  does  not  capture  income  inequality \namong the poor or the depth of poverty. For instance, it fails to account for the fact that some people \n                                                           \n1 For a discussion on reasons consumption is preferred, check: Deaton, Angus (2003). \u201cHousehold Surveys, \nConsumption, and the Measurement of Poverty\u201d. Economic Systems Research, Vol. 15, No. 2, June 2003 \n\n\fLast updated: 24 January 2017 \n \n\n \nmay  be  living  just  below  the  poverty  line,  while  others  experience  far  greater  shortfalls.  Policymakers \nseeking to make the largest possible impact on the headcount measure might be tempted to direct their \npoverty alleviation resources to those closest to the poverty line (and therefore least poor). \n\nIssues may also arise when comparing poverty measures within countries when urban and rural poverty \nlines  represent  different  purchasing  powers.  For  example,  the  cost  of  living  is  typically  higher  in  urban \nthan  in  rural  areas.  One  reason  is  that  food  staples  tend  to  be  more  expensive  in  urban  areas.  So  the \nurban monetary poverty line should be higher than the rural poverty line. But it is not always clear that \nthe  difference  between  urban  and  rural  poverty  lines  found  in  practice  reflects  only  differences  in  the \ncost of living. In some countries the urban poverty line in common use has a higher real value\u2014meaning \nthat  it  allows  the  purchase  of  more  commodities  for  consumption\u2014than  does  the  rural  poverty  line. \nSometimes the difference has been so large as to imply that the incidence of poverty is greater in urban \nthan in rural areas, even though the reverse is found when adjustments are made only for differences in \nthe cost of living. As with international comparisons, when the real value of the poverty line varies it is \nnot clear how meaningful such urban-rural comparisons are. \n\nLastly, these income/consumption based poverty indicators do not fully reflect the other dimensions of \npoverty such as inequality, vulnerability, and lack of voice and power of the poor. \n\n"

The  unit  of \nanalysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as \nmultidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds.  \n \nEU countries, North Macedonia and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional \npoverty  using  the  concept  of  \"people  at  risk  of  poverty  or  social  exclusion\"  (AROPE)  calculated  by \nEUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of \nthree indicators, and individuals are considered as \"at risk of poverty or social exclusion\" if they are \"at risk \nof poverty\" or \"severely materially deprived\" or \"living in a household with a very low work intensity\".  \n \nThere  is  a  multidimensional  poverty  measure  specifically  designed  for  children.  A  child  is  considered \nmultidimensionally  poor  if  s/he  is  simultaneously  deprived  in  multiple  dimensions.  It  identifies  the \ndimensions  of  poverty  and the  indicators  under  each  dimension,  and  has  a  similar  structure  to  the  AF \nmethodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets \nof dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and \nconducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty \nheadcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of \nchild multidimensional poverty. \n \n"

IUU fishing undermines national and \nregional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks and, as a consequence, inhibits progress towards \nachieving the goals of long-term sustainability and responsibility as set forth in, inter alia, Chapter 17 of \nAgenda 21 and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Moreover, IUU fishing greatly \ndisadvantages and discriminates against those fishers that act responsibly, honestly and in accordance \nwith the terms of their fishing authorizations. This is a compelling reason why IUU fishing must be dealt \nwith expeditiously and in a transparent manner. If IUU fishing is not curbed, and if IUU fishers target \nvulnerable stocks that are subject to strict management controls or moratoria, efforts to rebuild those \nstocks to healthy levels will not be achieved. To efficiently curb IUU fishing a number of different \ninternational instruments have been developed over the years that focus on the implementation of the \ndifferent responsibilities of States.  \n \nThe instruments covered by this indicator and their role in combatting IUU fishing are as follows: \n \n\u2022 \nThis instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built upon. UNCLOS defines \nthe rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, establishing \nguidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. It is a \nbinding instrument, although its principles may also be applied by countries who are not party to it. \n \n\u2022 \n\nThe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \n\nThe Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of \nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement) \n\nThe UN Fish Stocks Agreement entered into force on 11 December 2001, and is the most comprehensive \nof the binding international instruments in defining the role of Regional Fisheries Management \nOrganisations and elaborating measures that could be taken in relation to IUU fishing activities. Although \nthe UN Fish Stocks Agreement applies primarily to the highly migratory and straddling fish stocks on the \nhigh seas, its broad acceptance and application is evidenced by the reinforcement of other international \ninstruments, implementation at the regional level, and to some extent by State practice within areas of \nnational jurisdiction. \n \n\u2022 \n\nThe International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \nUnregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU) \n\nThe objective of the IPOA is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all States with \ncomprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate \nregional fisheries management organizations established in accordance with international law. This \ninstrument covers all the aspects of a State\u2019s responsibilities including, flag State responsibilities, coastal \nState measures, port State measures, internationally agreed market-related measures, research and \nregional fisheries management organizations. \n \n\u2022 \n\nThe 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA) \n\nThe FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \nUnregulated Fishing entered into force on the 5th of June 2016. The main purpose of the Agreement is to \nprevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the \nimplementation of robust port State measures. The Agreement envisages that parties, in their capacities The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance (VG-FSP) \n\nas port States, will apply the Agreement in an effective manner to foreign vessels when seeking entry to \nports or while they are in port. The application of the measures set out in the Agreement will, inter alia, \ncontribute to harmonized port State measures, enhanced regional and international cooperation and \nblock the flow of IUU-caught fish into national and international markets. \n \n\u2022 \nThe FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance spell out a range of actions that countries can \ntake to ensure that vessels registered under their flags do not conduct IUU fishing, including monitoring, \ncontrol and surveillance (MCS) activities, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and observers. They \npromote information exchange and cooperation among countries so that flag states are in a position to \nrefuse to register vessels that are \"flag-hopping\" by attempting to register with another flag state or to \nrefuse vessels that have been reported for IUU fishing. The Guidelines also include recommendations on \nhow countries can encourage compliance and take action against non-compliance by vessels, as well as \non how to enhance international cooperation to assist developing countries to fulfil their flag state \nresponsibilities. \n \n\u2022 \n\nThe FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management \nMeasures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement) \n\nThe 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement entered into force on the 24th of April 2003.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nCivil society organizations (CSOs) make a difference in international development. They provide \ndevelopment services and humanitarian relief, innovate in service delivery, build local capacity and \nadvocate with and for the poor. Acting alone, however, their impact is limited in scope, scale and \nsustainability. CSOs need to engage in government policy processes more effectively. The development of \nsustainable human settlements calls for the active engagement of all key stakeholders with particular \nattention to project/programme beneficiaries and vulnerable groups.  Therefore local and national \ngovernments should strive to: a) facilitate and protect people\u2019s participation and civic engagement \nthrough independent civil society organizations that can be from diverse backgrounds - local, national, \nand international; b) promote civic and human rights education and training programmes to make urban \nresidents aware of their rights and the changing roles of diverse women, men, and young women and \nmen in urban settings; c) remove the barriers that block participation of socially marginalized groups and \npromote non-discrimination and the full and equal participation of women, young men and women and \nmarginalized groups. To monitor this indicator fully, it is important to define cities as unique entities and \ndefine what constitutes direct participation structures of civil society. Urban planning and management \nare more clear concepts that UN-Habitat has worked on developing for the last few decades and these \nare well articulated in the urban agenda documents. Experts who have worked on the methodological \ndevelopments of this indicator have there put forth the below definitions to help guide the work on this \nindicator. \n \nRationale: \nThis indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, urban managers and planners to \nintegrate resident and civil society participation in urban planning and management at various levels. \nLocal authorities and governments, along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing \nthe value of civil society and residents\u2019 participation in strengthening the urban development processes. \nThis people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for local ownership, and \nthe implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. \n \nCivil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between government and the public \nby communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a cooperative manner. In many cases when \nurban planning decisions are made without consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is \na negative impact on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide \n\n\fLast updated: November 2018 \n \n\nvarieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding the interlinkages and \nnature of problems and potential solutions facing different urban settings.  \n \nUrban development is a reflection of ideology and national institutions. Public participation means a \nbroader consensus is built and this greatly enhances political interaction between citizens and \ngovernment, and enhances the legitimacy of the planning process and the plan itself. A plan is more \neffective if a broad coalition supports the proposal and works together to deliver it.  \n \nCivil society and public participation in urban management and governance also shows respect to \nparticipants\u2019 opinion, needs, aspirations and assets. It can boost their enthusiasm for citizenship and \npolitics, and strengthens their influence in urban planning and public life. When conflicting claims and \nviews are considered, there is a much higher possibility that public trust and buy-in increases in the \noutcome. This has broader implications for building an active, inclusive and equitable society and more \ninclusive and sustainable urban environments. \n \nConcepts: \nMany urban related SDGs require global monitoring with the \u2018city\u2019 as the unit of analysis. In order to \nmonitor the urban SDGs in particular, it is necessary to agree on a global/common definition of what \nconstitutes a \u2018city\u2019. A standard city definition will assist in the monitoring of the SDGs by ensuring that the \nstudy areas for the spatial urban SDGs are standardized and easily reproducible, and will add clarity to \nthe methodologies and approaches to the collection of data to support the land and rural related \nindicators. UN-Habitat in collaboration with New York University and European Commission\u2019s Joint \nResearch Centre has adopted two definitions of cities.  \n \n\na)  City as defined by its Urban extent (built-up and urbanized open space) - New York University \nUrban extent is defined as the total area occupied by the built-up area and the urbanized open space. \nThe built-up area is defined as the contiguous area occupied by buildings and other impervious surfaces, \nbut excluding urbanized open space, both public and private, as well as vacant lands. \n \nLandsat imagery1 is used to identify and classify the built-up pixels into 3 types depending on the share of \nbuilt-up density (urbanness) in a 1-km2 circle of a given building: \n\n\u2022  Urban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density \n\n\u2022 \n\ngreater than 50%.  \nSuburban built-up area: built-up pixels where the walking distance circle has a built-up density \nbetween 25%-50%. It also includes subdivided land, whether it is wholly unbuilt or not. \n\u2022  Rural built-up area: built-up pixels where walking distance circle has a built-up density of less \n\nthan 25% and that are not on subdivided land.  \n\n\u2022  The urbanized open space (mainly refers to unbuilt areas including open countryside, forests, \n\n\u2022 \n\ncrop fields, parks, unbuilt urban areas, cleared land) is classified into 3 types: \nFringe open space consists of all open space pixels within 100 meters of urban or suburban \npixels; \n\n                                                           \n1 Landsat Imagery is made up of several spectral bands that can be used to identify impervious surfaces \nroughly corresponding to built-up areas, making it possible to classify them by human-assisted algorithms into \nthree classes with a high degree of accuracy. \n\n\fLast updated: November 2018 \n \n\n\u2022  Captured open space consists of all open space clusters that are fully surrounded by urban and \n\nsuburban built-up pixels and the fringe open space pixels around them, and that are less than \n200 hectares in area; and \n\n\u2022  Rural open space consists of all open spaces that are not fringe or captured open spaces. \n\n \nThe fringe open space and captured open space together, make up the urbanized open space in a given \nstudy area.

Based on \nthe share of the local population living in 3 different types of clusters, local administrative units (LAUs) \nare classified into three types of area: thinly populated area (rural area); intermediate density area \n(towns and suburbs/small urban area), and densely populated area (cities/large urban area) following a \n2-step procedure.  \n \nIn a first step, grid cells of 1 km2 are classified into one of the three following clusters, according to their \npopulation size and density: \n\n\u2022  High-density cluster/urban centre: contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 1 500 \n\ninhabitants per km2 and a minimum population of 50 000; \n\n\u2022  Urban cluster: cluster of contiguous grid cells of 1 km2 with a density of at least 300 inhabitants \n\nper km2 and a minimum population of 5 000; \n\n\u2022  Rural grid cell: grid cell outside high-density clusters and urban clusters. \n\n \nIn a second step, local administrative units are then classified into one of three types of areas: \n\n\u2022  Densely populated area (alternative names: cities or large urban area): at least 50 % live in high-\ndensity clusters; in addition, each high-density cluster should have at least 75 % of its population \nin densely-populated LAUs; this also ensures that all high-density clusters are represented by at \nleast one densely-populated LAU, even when this cluster represents less than 50 % of the \npopulation of that LAU; \nIntermediate density area (alternative name: towns and suburbs or small urban area): less than \n50 % of the population lives in rural grid cells and less than 50 % live in high-density \nclusters;Thinly populated area (alternative name: rural area): more than 50 % of the population \nlives in rural grid cells. \n\n\u2022 \n\n \nOther concepts \nDemocratic participation: Structures allow and encourage participation of civil society representing a \ncross-section of society that allows for equal representation of all members of the community with equal \nrights for participation and voting.  \n \nDirect participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society accessing and actively engaging in \ndecision-making, without intermediaries, at every stage of the urban planning and management process. \n \nRegular participation: Structures allow and encourage civil society participation in urban planning and \nmanagement processes at every stage, and at least every six months. \n \n\n\fLast updated: November 2018 \n \n\nMarginalized groups: Groups of people that are not traditionally given equal voice in governance \nprocesses. These include, but are not limited to, women, young men and women, low-income \ncommunities, ethnic minorities, religious minorities, people with disabilities, the elderly, and sexual and \ngender identity minorities and migrants. \n \nStructures: Any formal structure that allows for participation of civil society. This can include, but is not \nlimited to national or local legislation, policy, town council meetings, websites, elections, suggestion \nboxes, appeals processes, notice period for planning proposals etc.  \n \nCivil Society: The combination of non-governmental organizations, community groups, community-based \norganizations, regional representative groups, unions, research institutes, think tanks, professional \nbodies, non-profit sports and cultural groups, and any other groups that represent the interests and wills \nof the members and wider community.  \n \nUrban Management: The officials, including elected officials and public servants, that are responsible for \ncity-management, across all sectors, such as roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc. \nUrban Budget decision making: The process by which money is allocated to various sectors of urban \nmanagement, including roads, roads, water, sanitation, energy, public space, land title etc. \n \nUrban Planning, including Design and Agreements: The technical and political process that concerns the \ndevelopment and use of land, how the natural environment is used etc. Design includes over-arching and \nspecific design of public space, as well as zoning and land use definitions. Agreements refer to specific \ncontract/arrangements made with various groups in regard to their land, e.g. Indigenous groups, \nprotected natural environments etc. \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe indicator measures the availability of structures for civil society participation in urban planning and \nmanagement, which is a reflection of structures for citizen voices/participation. The fact that informed \nevaluators conduct the evaluation can introduce biases. These biases and discrepancies have been \nexamined in the pilot phases and so far the experiences is that the marginal differences are not as large \nas we were expecting.  Overall, the evaluators\u2019 assessments sometimes do not reflect a full analysis of the \neffectiveness or accessibility of these structures in its totality, but gives a local idea of how these \nevaluators view the inclusiveness and openness on these structures to accommodate the participation of \ncitizens and civil society. Changes in data will be examined for intra-city differences and within country \ndifferences over time to understand more sources for variations and internal consistencies.  \nWithin the civic society landscape, there are many types of players including civil societies led by \nindividuals, community groups, advocates, corporations and foundations.  Similarly, there are many \ndifferent views about the relevance and importance of civil society participation particularly, perhaps, \namong different groups as listed above and for these different structures at the urban level maybe \navailable for involvement or not.  \n \nFinally, civic society engagement in urban planning and management involves overlapping pathways, and \ngoals as well as a mix of planned and unpredicted elements.   Advancing toward a measurement frame is \nintended to help sort out theories and pathways \u2013 not to set hard boundary lines, but rather to help both \nurban managers and communities better understand what they are trying to achieve, and how they are \ngetting there. \n \n\n\fLast updated: November 2018 \n \n\n"

Moreover, a reference period is usually required in \norder to characterize the use of a specific area of agricultural land and identify subcategories. \n \nAs clearly shown in the figure below, agricultural land is a subset of the total land. \n\n \n\nIn particular, following the WCA 2020, agricultural land includes: \n\nClassification of land use (WCA 2020) \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nland under temporary crops1 \nland under temporary meadows and pastures2 \nland temporarily fallow3 \nland under permanent crops4 \nland under permanent meadows and pastures5 \n\n \nIt excludes: \n\u2022 \n\nland under farm buildings and farmyards \n\n                                                           \n1 Defined as: \u201call land used for crops with a less than one-year growing cycle\u201d (WCA 2020). Temporary crops comprise all the \ncrops that need to be sown or planted after each harvest for new production (e.g. cereals). The full list of crops classified as \n\u2018temporary\u2019 is provided in the WCA 2020, page 165 (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4913e.pdf). \n2 Defined as land that has been cultivated for less than five years with herbaceous or forage crops for mowing or pasture. \n3 When arable land is kept at rest for at least one agricultural year because of crop rotation or other reasons, such as the \nimpossibility to plant new crops, this is defined as temporarily fallow. This category does not include the land that it is not \ncultivated at the time of the survey but will be sowed and planted before the end of the agricultural year.  \n4 Area that is cultivated with long term crops that do not need to be replanted every year, such as fruits and nuts, some types \nof stimulant crops, etc. \n5 Land cultivated with herbaceous forage crops or is left as wild prairie or grazing land for more than five years. forest and other wooded land \narea used for aquaculture (including inland and coastal waters if part of the holding) \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  other area not elsewhere classified \n\n \nSince the indicator 5.a.1 focuses on agricultural land, it excludes all the forms of land that are not \nconsidered \u2018agricultural\u2019, including land under farm buildings and farmyards. \n \n\nAgricultural population \nIndicator 5.a.1 uses \u2018agricultural population\u2019 as denominator, instead of the total population, because \ntenure rights over agricultural land are relevant especially for individuals whose livelihood relies on \nagriculture. More specifically, since agricultural land includes both crop land and meadows and pastures, \ntenure rights over agricultural land are relevant for households operating land and / or raising or tending \nlivestock. Thus, the reference population (denominator) for indicator 5.a.1 are: adult individuals living in \nagricultural households, i.e. households that operated land for agricultural purposes and / or raised \nlivestock over the past 12 months, regardless of the final purpose of the production. \nThe long reference period allows to capture agricultural households even if interviewed off-season, while \nthe inclusion of all purposes includes households that produce only for own consumption. \n \nEngagement in forestry and logging and fishing and aquaculture is not considered because the focus of the \nindicator is on agricultural land. Households who have tenure rights over agricultural land but do not farm \nthe land are excluded from the reference population, because the indicator focuses on households whose \nlivelihood is linked to practicing agriculture. Moreover, households whose member/s is/are engaged in the \nagricultural  sector  only as wage  laborer/s  are  excluded  from  the reference  population.  Indeed,  while  it \nmakes sense to classify as \u2018agricultural\u2019 a household where someone is operating land / raising livestock on \nhis/her own, the same cannot be said for households where a member operates land / raises livestock for \nsomeone else because, in this case, agricultural land is not an asset relevant for the household economy. \n \nOnce a household is classified as an \u2018agricultural household\u2019, all the adult individuals are eligible to be asked \nabout  their  tenure  right  status  over  agricultural  land.  The  adoption  of  a  household  perspective  is \nparticularly  important  from  the  gender  perspective,  because  in  many  agricultural  households,  women \noften consider themselves as not being involved in agriculture, whereas they provide substantive support \nto  the  household\u2019s  agricultural  activities.  In  addition,  the  individual\u2019s  livelihood  cannot  be  completely \ndetached from the livelihood of the other household members; and in particular, for households operating \nland  or raising  livestock,  land is  an  important  asset  for all the  individuals  and  protect  them  in  case  the \nhousehold dissolves. \n \nHowever, identifying such households is not trivial, because: \n\nI. \n\nII. \n\nAgricultural work is highly irregular and strongly affected by seasonality, therefore if the survey \nquestions adopt a short recall period, we risk excluding individuals engaged in agriculture because \nthey did not practice agriculture at the time of the survey or simply because they were interviewed \noff-season. \nAgriculture  is  sometimes  practiced  only  or  mainly  for  own  consumption,  without  any  market \norientation (so, with no or little income) and therefore not necessarily perceived as an economic \nactivity strictu sensu. \n\n \nOwnership and tenure rights over agricultural land: It is challenging to define and to operationalize ownership and tenure rights in a way that provides reliable \nand comparable figures across countries. \n \nLand ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property \nsystems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. However, in systems where land is owned by the State, \nthe term \u2018land ownership\u2019 refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property \nsystem \u2013 for instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the State, often for \nseveral decades, and that are transferrable. In this context, it is more appropriate to speak of tenure rights. \nNonetheless, as emphasized by the EDGE (Evidence and Data for Gender Equality) project6, focusing on \nlegally recognized documents is not sufficient to analyse the complexity of rights related to land, especially \nin  developing  countries  and  from  the  gender  perspective.  The  main  factor  limiting  the  universal \napplicability of legally recognized documents is the diverse penetration of such legally binding documents. \n \nConsidering the above, as well as the need to propose an indicator valid at global level, the indicator 5.a.1 \nrelies on the three conditions (proxies): 1) Presence of legally recognised documents in the name of the \nindividual; 2) right to sell; 3) right to bequeath.  \n \n\n1) Presence of legally recognised documents in the name of the individual \nIt refers to the existence of any document an individual can use to claim property rights before the law \nover an asset by virtue of the individual\u2019s name being listed as owner or holder on the document.  \nGiven  the  differences  between  legal  systems  across  countries  it  is  not  possible  to  clearly  define  an \nexhaustive list of documents that could be considered a proof of tenure security. However, depending on \nthe national legal framework the following documents may be considered as formal titles: \n\u2022  Title deed: \u201ca written or printed instrument that effects a legal disposition\u201d7 \n\u2022  Certificate of occupancy or land certificate \u201cA land certificate is a certified copy of an entry in a \nland title system and provides proof of the ownership and of encumbrances on the land at that \ntime\u201d8 \n\n\u2022  Purchase agreement: a contract between a seller and a buyer to dispose of land \n\u2022  Registered certificate of hereditary acquisition \n\u2022  Certificate of customary tenure: an official state document indicating the owner or holder of the \nland because customary law has recognized that particular person as the rightful owner. It can be \nused as proof of legal right over the land. These certificates include, among others, certificates of \ncustomary ownership and customary use. \n\n\u2022  Registered certificate of perpetual / long term lease: \u201ca contractual agreement between a landlord \nand a tenant for the tenancy of land. A lease or tenancy agreement is the contractual document \nused to create a leasehold interest or tenancy\u201d9 \n\n\u2022  Registered short term (less than 3 years) rental contract \n\u2022  Certificate issued for adverse possession or prescription: is a certificate indicating that the \n\nadverse possessor acquires the land after a prescribed statutory period.   \n\n                                                           \n\n6 Source: \u201cUN Methodological Guidelines on the Production of Statistics on Asset Ownership from a Gender \nPerspective\u201d Draft Guidelines submitted at the UN Statistical Commission in March 2017 \n7 Source: \u201cMultilingual thesaurus on land tenure\u201d, FAO 2003 \n8 Source: \u201cMultilingual thesaurus on land tenure\u201d, FAO 2003 \n9 Source: \u201cMultilingual thesaurus on land tenure\u201d, FAO 2003 In order to overcome the lack of written documentation and to generate a globally valid indicator it \nbecomes crucial to take into account also the alienation rights over land, which can be present even in \ncontexts where tenure rights are not documented.  \n \nAlienation is defined as the ability to transfer a given asset during lifetime or after death. The right to sell \nand to bequeath are considered as objective facts that carry legal force as opposed to a simple self-\nreported declaration of tenure rights over land. In particular: \n \n2) Right to sell \nIt refers to the ability of an individual to permanently transfer the asset in question in return for cash or \nin-kind benefits.  \n \n3) Right to bequeath \nIt refers to the ability of an individual to pass on the asset in question to another person(s) after his or her \ndeath, by written will, oral will (if recognized by the country) or when the deceased left no will, through \nintestate succession.  \n \nThe decision to rely on the three proxies above (availability of a legal document, right to sell, right to \nbequeath) is justified by the results of the seven field tests conducted under the framework on the EDGE \nproject. In particular, the tests demonstrated:  \n \n\n\u2022  The lack of reliability of reported ownership/possession. In fact, reported ownership/possession \n\nwas often neither supported by any kind of documentation nor by the possession of any \nalienation right. \n\n\u2022  The need to consider as \u2018owners\u2019 or \u2018holders of tenure rights\u2019 only the individuals who are linked \nto the agricultural land by an objective right over it, including both formal legal possession and \nalienation rights. \n\n\u2022  The need to combine different proxies, as no single proxy is universally valid.  \n\n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \n \nRevenue is defined in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.23) of GFSM 2014 an increase in net worth resulting from a \ntransaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities. General government \nunits have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes (GFS code 11), social \ncontributions (GFS code 12), grants (GFS code 13), and other revenue (GFS code 14). Of these, \ncompulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units. In \nparticular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional \nunits. Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make \nprovision for social insurance benefits payable. Grants are transfers receivable by government units from \nother resident or nonresident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the \ndefinition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution. Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i) property income; (ii) sales of goods and \nservices; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, \nand claims related to nonlife insurance and standardized guarantee schemes. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThe transactions and the associated classifications are detailed in Chapter 5 of GFSM 2014 and are \nstructured to demonstrate how general government (and public sector) units raise revenue. Only those \ntaxes and social insurance contributions that are evidenced by tax assessments and declarations, customs \ndeclarations, and similar documents are considered to create revenue for government units. Thus, the \ndifference between assessments and expected collections represents a claim that has no real value and \nshould not be recorded as revenue (see GFSM 2014 paragraph 5.20). The analytic framework of GFSM \n2014 (like that of the GFSM 2001) builds on the GFSM 1986 framework, and extends it by incorporating \nadditional elements that are useful in assessing fiscal policy. An important example is the treatment of \nnonfinancial assets, where the sale of such assets is no longer included in revenue. The disposal of a \nnonfinancial asset by sale or barter is not revenue because it has no effect on net worth. Rather, it \nchanges the composition of the balance sheet by exchanging one asset (the nonfinancial asset) for \nanother (the proceeds of the sale). Similarly, amounts receivable from loan repayments and loan \ndisbursements are not revenue. In general, transactions that increase net worth result from current \noperations. Capital transfers are an exception. In GFSM 2014, capital transfers receivable are classified as \nrevenue because they increase the recipient\u2019s net worth and they are often indistinguishable from \ncurrent transfers in their effect on government operations. In recording cash-based accounting revenue \ntransactions, data representing the tax payments received by government, net of refunds paid out during \nthe period covered should be reported. These data will include taxes paid after the original assessment, \ntaxes paid or refunds deducted from taxes after subsequent assessments, and taxes paid or refunds \ndeducted after any subsequent reopening of the accounts. Therefore, total tax revenue could be \npresented on a gross basis as the total amount of all taxes accrued, or on a net basis as the gross amount \nminus tax refunds. Revenue categories are presented gross of expense categories for the same or related \ncategory. In particular, interest revenue is presented gross rather than as net interest expense or net \ninterest revenue. Similarly, social benefits and social contributions, grant revenue and expense, and rent \nrevenue and expense are presented gross. Also, sales of goods and services are presented gross of the \nexpenses incurred in their production. In cases of erroneous or unauthorized transactions, revenue \ncategories are presented net of refunds of the relevant revenue, and expense categories are presented \nnet of inflows from the recovery of the expense. For example, refunds of income taxes may be paid when \nthe amount of taxes withheld or otherwise paid in advance of the final determination exceeds the actual \ntax due. Such refunds are recorded as a reduction in tax revenue. For this reason, tax revenue is \npresented net of non-payable tax credits (see GFSM 2014 paragraphs 5.29\u20135.32). \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers\u2019 \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers\u2019 exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries\u2019 supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries\u2019 supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  Nonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries\u2019 \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries\u2019 compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF\u2019s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators.

A coordinated effort from government through a NUP or RDP provides the best \nopportunity for achieving sustainable urbanization and balanced territorial development by linking sectorial \npolicies, connecting national, regional and local government policies, strengthening urban, peri-urban and \nrural links through balanced territorial development.   \n  \nThis indicator provides a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national urban policies. It serves as \ngap analysis to support policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and policies among \ncountries that can promote partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. This indicator is both \nprocess oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and other SDGs \nindicators with an urban component. The indicator has the ability to be applicable at multi jurisdictions levels, \ni.e covering a number of areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner.  \n \nThe explicit introduction of National Urban Policy in the wording of indicator 11.a.1 brings emphasis to a policy \nprocess that can better satisfy the requirements of target 11.a through sectorial, territorial and jurisdictional \nintegration and coordination steered by the national level.  This is so because, evidence shows that NUP can \nsupport positive economic, social and environmental links by ensuring at the highest level of government the \ncoherent alignment of sectorial policies to support sustainable and inclusive urbanization2. With the World \nincreasingly urbanizing, it is becoming clear today that how cities are managed and planned has ramifications \nwell beyond their boundaries and that urbanization is a key force for national and sustainable development.  \n \nUrbanization has indeed historically been a catalyst for economic growth and social progress, and even holds \nthe possibility for the protection and more efficient use of natural resources, and climate change mitigation \n\n                                                 \n2 UN-Habitat and OECD, 2018, Global State of National Urban Policy \n\n and adaptation. However, this positive impact is not automatic, particularly in developing countries - where \nrapid and/or unplanned urbanization can bring about negative economic, social and environmental \nexternalities with increasing congestion, sprawl, informality, social exclusion and conflict \u2013 if the provision of \nservices and infrastructure does not keep up with natural and internal population growth , equitable \ndistribution, migration patterns to the city, etc. Governments need to be sensitive to this fact that urbanization \nis a nation-wide and multi-sectorial issue. Therefore, NUPs provide the framework to harness urbanization \ndividends and mitigate its negative externalities.  A national urban policy calls attention to the impact of \nsectorial governmental policies on the sustainable development of cities and encourages and enables the \nvertical and horizontal coordination of government departments and their policies to best support it.  \n \nThis consideration in turn also encourages more cooperation and coordination between different levels of \ngovernment to support the development and implementation of a national vision for urban development, \neffectively strengthening national and regional development planning. The urban policy process is led at the \nnational level to ensure the articulation and coordination of different sectors and government levels but \nengages both top down and bottom up processes. For a successful implementation, a NUP must create an \nenabling, collaborative and cooperative institutional environment, mobilizing different levels, assessing and \nbuilding their capacities, and establishing jointly defined and transparent responsibilities for implementation. \nSubnational governments are key implementation partner due to their proximity to citizens and role in \ndelivering services and infrastructure. As such, a NUP does not replace regional and local development policies \nand plans but strengthens them and relies on their horizontal alignment and vertical articulation, especially to \ntackle cross boundary challenges such as sustainable resource management, infrastructure development, \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation, or urban-rural linkages.  \n \nFinally, NUP as an overarching framework articulating and aligning subnational and local plans and policies \nunder a common vision for urbanization that also makes it particularly suited to consider the urban-peri-\nurban-rural continuum. This urban and rural consideration is a key element of data disaggregation and \nadministrative delineation in territorial planning. However, the importance of urban-rural linkages (through \nflows of people, natural resources, capital, goods, ecosystem services, information, technology, ideas and \ninnovation) is increasingly being acknowledged for sustainable and integrated territorial development. The \nNew Urban Agenda (NUA) for instance stresses the need to reduce urban and rural disparities to foster \nequitable development and encourage connectivity. Target 11.a is the only one that explicitly considers urban, \nperi-urban and rural areas under a city-centric SDG 11. NUP is the adequate framework to strengthen and \ndirect urban and rural flows towards the most sustainable patterns of consumption and equitable resource \ndistribution, as they can strike the balance between competition and solidarity between territories of a \ncountry.  \n \nUrban Policies are more broadly instrumental for the implementation and monitoring of global agendas  \nNational Urban Policies therefore enable a cross-sectorial approach, and the horizontal and vertical \ninstitutional coordination needed to address the challenges and opportunities of urbanization, which are \nincreasingly recognized as going beyond the boundaries of the city. Intergovernmental agreements have \nindeed shown a new interest in urbanization for sustainable development. This is illustrated of course in \nAgenda 2030 with its introduction of a standalone urban SDG-11, but many other SDGs also have clear urban \ndimensions and implications. Following the Agenda 2030, the United Nations Conference on Housing and \nSustainable Development (Habitat III) adopted the New Urban Agenda, a roadmap for the next 20 years setting \nnew global standards for sustainable urban development. Finally, although the Paris Agreement on Climate \nChange does not explicitly mention cities, the management of urbanization is still essential to addressing \nclimate change, as is illustrated by the fact that two third of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \ncontain clear urban references and content3. As an instrument for governments to harness the dynamics of \nurbanization for national development, NUPs have therefore been identified as a key tool for the \nimplementation and monitoring of such agendas.  \n \nThe Policy Paper on National Urban Policies prepared for Habitat III for instance explained that a NUP should \nconstitute an important part of any serious attempt to implement the SDGs and should become a key \n\n                                                 \n3 UN-Habitat, 2016, Sustainable Urbanization in the Paris Agreement. Comparative review for urban \ncontent in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)  \n\n instrument to measure the achievement of the SDGs. As explained above, NUPs are a particularly appropriate \nframework to achieve target 11.a, and more generally can be instrumental in creating the necessary enabling \nframework to implement the urban development objectives of SDG 11. For instance, the NUA explicitly \nidentifies NUPs as essential to achieve the urban paradigm shift it advocates for, recognizing the leading role of \nnational governments [\u2026] in the implementation of inclusive and effective urban policies and legislation for \nsustainable urban development (NUA \u2013 15.b). Moreover, the Urban-Rural Linkages Guiding Principles provide \npractical approach and actions to enhance territorial cohesion including via policies4. OECD set of urban and \nrural policies are additional frameworks that are very important to enhance social, economic an economic links \nacross urban-rural and peri-urban territories5.  \n \nFinally, NUPs can also be an instrument to coordinate the urban components of NDCs across scales and sectors \nand mainstream the principles of climate change adaptation and mitigation for the implementation of the \nParis Agreement6.  \n \nQualifiers for a measurable process indicator  \nGiven their instrumental role for the implementation and monitoring of global urban agendas, the adoption of \na NUP by a national government can be considered as a strong indicator of political commitment to promoting \nsustainable urban development. It also makes them particularly well suited for measuring target 11.a through \na process indicator. As a process indicator, 11.a.1 is indeed supposed to assess the progress made towards \ncreating an enabling environment that will ensure achievement of the outcomes and impacts of the targets of \nthe Sustainable Development Agenda. Its definition sets the foundation on how target 11.a can be achieved, \nthrough measurable means. The proposed revision of the indicator therefore supplements national urban \npolicies and regional development plans with 3 qualifiers that indicate the means of successfully reaching the \nrequirements of target 11.a.  \n \nThe first qualifier is that policies and plans should respond to population dynamics. Grounding policies and \nplans in the most current and comprehensive spatial and demographic data and projections is indeed a \nprerequisite for a successful implementation. The challenges posed by rapid urbanization indeed stem from \nthe fact that policy and planning framework and their implementation are outpaced by population growth, \ncoupled with policy priorities that may not prioritize inclusive development for all current and future urban \nresidents, which together result in straining the provision of infrastructure and services, and causing socio-\neconomic and environmental damages. Forecasting demographic trends and needs in the diagnosis phase of \npolicies and plans enables governments to plan ahead for urbanization and provide adequate land and \ninfrastructure in a more cost-efficient and less socially disruptive way than trying to catch up, repair and \nupgrade uncontrolled expansion. This process of developing urban policies and plans can also be the occasion \nto improve national data collection on urban areas, and serve other SDG-11 indicators, as well as provide a \nbaseline for monitoring the outcomes of such interventions.  \n \nThe second qualifier requires policies and plans to ensure balanced territorial development, in a direct answer \nto target 11.a.1\u2019s reference to the urban, peri-urban and rural continuum. Policies and plans should adopt a \nbroad territorial perspective and consider the linkages and flows from urban to rural areas not only to avoid \nand reduce social, economic and environmental disparities between territories but also to promote distinctive \nstrengths and encourage beneficial interactions for the most efficient path to sustainable growth for the \ncountry. Such a perspective for policies and plans is achieved higher territorial scale than cities, through \nregional plans and national policies.  \n \nFinally, the third qualifier is to increase local fiscal space. As integrated NUPs and regional development plans \nintroduce a more coordinated and decentralized articulation of responsibilities for urban development, \n\n                                                 \n4 UN-Habitat, 2019, Urban-Rural Linkages, Guiding Principles: Framework for Action to Advance Integrated \nTerritorial Development (https://urbanrurallinkages.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/url-gp-1.pdf) \n5 OECD, 2019, OECD Principles on Urban Policy (https://www.oecd.org/cfe/Brochure-OECD-Principles-\nUrban-Policy.pdf) and OECD Principles on Rural Policy (https://www.oecd.org/rural/rural-development-\nconference/documents/Rural-principles.pdf) \n6 UN-Habitat, 2016, Addressing Climate Change in National Urban Policies \n \n\n ensuring that subnational and local governments have the adequate financial resources to carry out their \nresponsibilities is essential to the successful implementation of policies and plans. The transfer of \ncompetences from central to local levels must therefore be accompanied by a commensurate devolution of \nfinancial resources and autonomy. Moreover, in times of shrinking governmental budgets, the capacity of local \ngovernments to expand and diversify endogenous financial resources and revenues and not rely too heavily on \ncentral transfers should be increased. This involves more fiscal power and capacity, better land value capture \nmechanisms \u2013 which go hand in hand with a clear and enforceable land policy framework \u2013 and innovative \nfinancial partnerships, for instance collaborating with the private sector for service and infrastructure delivery. \nIn all cases, fiscal policies and mechanisms must remain subordinated to the established urban policy and \nplanning objectives: central transfers must be embedded within the NUP framework, and take into account \nterritorial equity; and local fiscal systems must be closely tied to local territorial plans so as to incentivize \nsustainable patterns of development.  \n \nConcepts: \nIntroducing NUP \u2013 an appropriate framework to achieve target 11.a and more broadly a recognized tool of \nimplementation and monitoring of global urban agendas \u2013 along with regional development plans, and adding \nthree measurable qualifiers as requirements for successful plans and policies, makes indicator 11.a.1 not only \na more adequate, measurable and implementable process indicator for target 11.a.1, but also will serve more \nbroadly the progress of SDGs and the new urban agenda.  \n \nThis revised indicator is indeed suitable for all countries and regions, and lends itself to regional analyses, as \nwell as other forms of aggregation and disaggregation, according to development level, for example. It is also \napplicable at multiple territorial levels.  \n \nMoreover, monitoring this indicator will help more broadly with NUP monitoring and help increase awareness, \ncapacity and knowledge of best practices for sustainable urban policy in the process. Also, due to the \nmultidisciplinary dimension of NUPs and their role in global agendas, the enhanced data collection and analysis \ncapacity that would be permitted by this indicator revision would participate in guiding the necessary steps to \ncreate a more enabling urban policy environment to support SDG 11 and urban dimensions of other SDGs. \nNUP monitoring according to SDGs would for instance serve as a gap analysis to help formulate tailored \nrecommendations and identify best practices. \n \nComments and limitations: \nUN-Habitat and UNFPA, along with many other partners such as OECD and Cities Alliance are working together \nto collect updated information from Member States regarding the three qualifiers in addition to other \nquestions pertinent to National Urban Policies and their implementation process. The survey7 results will \ninform the 2020 Global State of National Urban Policy Report. Many countries have filled in required \ninformation based on the specific qualifiers of indicator 11.a.1. which builds upon the 2018 NUP dataset8.  The \nsuccess of the indicator requires more capacity development and routine follow ups with ministries and NSOs \nat national levels, but sometimes also going beyond the national levels to ensure good understanding of the 3 \nsub-components. \n \n \n"

The risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth. \nii. The fertility level (i.e. the number of pregnancies or births that are experienced by women of \nreproductive age). \n \nThe maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time \nperiod per 100 000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death \nrelative to the number of live births and essentially captures (i) above. \n \nBy contrast, the maternal mortality rate (MMRate) is calculated as the number of maternal deaths \ndivided by person-years lived by women of reproductive age. The MMRate captures both the risk of \nmaternal death per pregnancy or per total birth (live birth or stillbirth), and the level of fertility in \nthe population. In addition to the MMR and the MMRate, it is possible to calculate the adult lifetime \nrisk of maternal mortality for women in the population. An alternative measure of maternal \nmortality, the proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal \ncauses (PM), is calculated as the number of maternal deaths divided by the total deaths among \nwomen aged 15\u201349 years. \n \nRelated Statistical measures of maternal mortality \n \nMaternal mortality ratio (MMR): Number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 \nlive births during the same time period. \n \n\n \n\n2 Maternal mortality rate (MMRate): Number of maternal deaths divided by person-years lived by \nwomen of reproductive age. \n \nAdult lifetime risk of maternal death: The probability that a 15-year-old woman will die eventually \nfrom a maternal cause. \n \nThe proportion of deaths among women of reproductive age that are due to maternal causes (PM): \nThe number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women \naged 15\u201349 years. \n \n"

    "metadata": "Definition: The level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources is the \nratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, \nafter taking into account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, \ninclude agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is \nalso known as water withdrawal intensity. \n \nConcepts: \nThis indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country\u2019s renewable freshwater \nresources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors \nis marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of \nthe resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a \nsituation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total \nrenewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources \nand potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.  \n \nTotal renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external \nrenewable water resources. The terms \u201cwater resources\u201d and \u201cwater withdrawal\u201d are understood here \nas freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal.  \n \nInternal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and \nrecharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation.  \n \nExternal renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into \nconsideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements \nor treaties.  \n \nTotal freshwater withdrawal (TFWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, \naquifers) for agriculture, industries and services1. It is estimated at the country level for the following \nthree main sectors: agriculture, services (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries (including \ncooling of thermoelectric plants). Freshwater withdrawal includes fossil groundwater. It does not include \nnon-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water \nand desalinated water.  \n \nEnvironmental flow requirements (EFR) are defined as the quantity and timing of freshwater flows and \nlevels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems, which, in turn, support human cultures, economies, \nsustainable livelihoods, and wellbeing.  Water quality and also the resulting ecosystem services are \nexcluded from this formulation which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and \nthe support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not important and should not \nbe taken care of.2 Methods of computation of EFR are extremely variable and range from global \nestimates to comprehensive assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water \nvolumes can be expressed in the same units as the TFWW, and then as percentages of the available water \nresources. \n \n\n                                                           \n1 In AQUASTAT, Services water withdrawal is reported as Municipal water withdrawal. \n2 They are indeed taken into account by other targets and indicators, such as 6.3.2, 6.5.1 and 6.6.1.

    "metadata": "Definition: \nIndicator 5.a.2 looks at the extent to which the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees \nwomen\u2019s equal rights to land ownership and/or control.  \n \nThe indicator \u201cmeasures\u201d the level to which a country\u2019s legal framework supports women\u2019s land rights, \nby testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted \ngood practices , in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women \n(CEDAW) ratified by 189 countries, and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the \nTenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT) endorsed unanimously by Committee of Food Security \n(CFS) members in 2012. \n The six proxies through which indicator 5.a.2 is monitored are the following: \nProxy A:  Joint registration of land compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives \nProxy B:  Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions \nProxy C: Women\u2019s and girls\u2019 equal inheritance rights \nProxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women\u2019s ownership and control over land \nProxy E: In legal systems that recognise customary land tenure, existence of explicit protection of the \nland rights of women \nProxy F: Mandatory quotas for women\u2019s participation in land management and administration \ninstitutions \n \nConcepts: \nThe indicator tracks progress on legal reforms that guarantee women\u2019s land rights (including customary) \nin terms of ownership and/or control.  \n \nThe indicator refers to customary law. The inclusion of the customary dimension in the indicator is very \nimportant because in many contexts in which these systems prevail, women\u2019s land rights tend to be \ndenied or insecure. However, the enormous diversity of customs and social norms that govern customary \nland among countries and their unwritten nature, create a significant challenge for assessing whether the \nproxies are present in these systems. To solve this issue, it is proposed that the customary dimension will \nbe considered only when the formal legal framework recognizes customary land tenure.  \n \nFinally, the indicator refers to ownership and/or control of land which are two critical but different \ndimensions regarding women\u2019s land rights. Land ownership refers to the legally recognised right to \nacquire, to use and to transfer landed property, while the control over land is associated with the ability \nto make decisions over land. \n \nKey definitions are the following: \n \nLand \nLand is defined as all immovable property \u2013 for instance the house, the land upon which a house is built \nand land which is used for other purposes, such as agricultural production. It also encompasses any other \nstructures built on land to meet permanent purposes. Legal frameworks commonly use the terms \n\u2018immovable property\u2019 or \u2018real property\u2019 when referring to land. \n \nLand ownership \nLand ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property \nsystems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. In systems where land is owned by the state, the term \nland ownership refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system \u2013 \nfor instance, long-term leases, occupancy, tenancy or use rights granted by the state that are \ntransferrable and are granted to users for several decades (for instance 99 years). \n \nControl over land \nControl over land is the ability to make decisions over land. It may include rights to make decisions about \nhow the land should be used, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the \nsale of crops, including what crops should be planted, and to benefit financially from the sale of crops.  \n \nCustomary land tenure Customary land tenure is defined as the bodies of rules and institutions governing the way land and \nnatural resources are held, managed, used and transacted within customary legal systems. \n \nCustomary legal systems \nCustomary legal systems are systems that exist at the local or community level, that have not been set up \nby the state, and that derive their legitimacy from the values and traditions of the indigenous or local \ngroup. Customary legal systems may or may not be recognized by national law.  \n \nLegal and policy framework \nThe legal and policy framework encompasses the Constitution, policy, primary legislation and secondary \nlegislation. The legal and policy framework includes customary legal systems where they have been \nrecognised by statutory law. \n \n  \nPersonal laws  \nPersonal law is defined as a set of codified rules and norms applying to a group of people sharing a \ncommon religious faith with regard to personal matters. These laws usually cover family relations, \nmarriage, and inheritance. The term can be used interchangeably with \u2018religious laws\u2019. \n \n \nPrimary legislation  \nPrimary legislation refers to (i) acts or statutes that have been formally adopted at national level \nfollowing the official parliamentary procedure for the passage of laws (in parliamentary systems); (ii) \nother acts at the national level with the force of law, such as decree-laws and legislative decrees and \notherwise (in parliamentary systems); (iii) other legal instruments that have that have been formally \nendorsed by a law-making body, for instance presidential and royal orders or presidential and royal \ndecrees (in non-parliamentary systems or systems where law-making power lies in an additional \ninstitution to the parliament). In all cases, primary legislation must have the force of law, be binding. For \nthe purposes of this assessment primary legislation also includes the Constitution.  \n \nSecondary legislation \nSecondary legislation includes subsidiary, delegated or subordinate legal instruments that have the force \nof law, are binding and shall not be in contradiction with primary legislation. They are usually passed by \nthe executive, such as national regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations, directions, circulars, orders, \nand implementing decrees. \n \nJoint registration \nJoint registration is where the names of both spouses or both partners in an unmarried couple, are \nentered into the land registry as the owners or principal users of the land being registered. Joint \nregistration signifies a form of shared tenure over the land \u2013 usually either a joint tenancy/occupancy or a \ntenancy in common). In legal systems which include a framework for land titling, joint registration is \ncommonly referred to as joint titling.   \n \nUnmarried couples \nUnmarried couples are defined as couples who live together (cohabit) in an intimate relationship, but who \nare not married in accordance with the marriage law of the country. Often this will refer to couples who \nwere married under custom or religious laws, where such marriages are not recognised or do not comply with the requirements of the formal law. It may also refer to relationships that are recognised by the state \nbut that are not considered a marriage \u2013 for instance a civil partnership and a de facto relationship that is \nregistered  with  the  state.  The  term  \u2018unmarried  couples\u2019  is  often  used  interchangeably  with  \u2018de  facto \nunions\u2019, \u2018consensual unions\u2019 or \u2018irregular unions\u2019. The members of an unmarried couple are referred to as \n\u2018partners\u2019. \n \nLand transactions \nLand transactions for the purpose of the methodology are major land transactions, specifically the sale and \nencumbrance (mortgage) of land.  \n \nInheritance \nInheritance is defined as property passing at the owner's death to the heir or those entitled to succeed. \n \nDeceased\u2019s estate \nThe deceased\u2019s estate encompasses the legal rights, interests and entitlements, to property of any kind \n(not  only  land) which  the  deceased  spouse  or  partner enjoyed  at  the  time  of  death, less  any  liabilities. \nDepending on the legal system, marital property may be excluded fully from the calculation of deceased\u2019s \nestate, or, the deceased\u2019s 50% share in the marital property will be included.  \n \nEqual inheritance rights for sons and daughters \nEqual inheritance rights for sons and daughters refer to the situation when the lines of succession in the \nlegal and policy framework governing inheritance states equality of rank and shares between brothers and \nsisters or between daughters and sons, or are gender neutral. \n \n \n"

[FAOSTAT] \n \n\n\u2022  Permanent crops \n\no  Permanent crops are the land cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be \nreplanted for several years (such as cocoa and coffee); land under trees and shrubs \nproducing flowers, such as roses and jasmine; and nurseries (except those for forest \ntrees, which should be classified under \"forest\"). Permanent meadows and pastures are \nexcluded from land under permanent crops. [FAOSTAT] \n \n\n\u2022  Proportion of irrigated land on the total cultivated land \n\no  Total harvested irrigated crop area, expressed in percentage.
