  "AIR_10": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human health.\nIn high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factors.\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution can be expressed as :\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of deaths\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DALYs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of years life lost (YLLs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YLLs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\nDeath (DALYs, or YLLs) rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distributionby applying the observed age-specific mortality (or other health outcomes) rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The full birth histories were used to estimate the probability of dying in children aged 5 to 14 (10q5) for three reference periods prior to each survey (0-3 years prior to the survey, 4-7 years, and 8-11 years). Summary birth histories collected in censuses and surveys were not included, because indirect demographic methods used to convert such data into mortality indices were originally designed to estimate mortality in children below age 5, and there has been little assessment of the performance of these indirect approaches when applied to older children\n\nMethod of estimation: The statistical model developed for under-five mortality (Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model \u2013 or B3 model) was used to obtain a smooth trend curve averaging over the estimates and accounting for potential outliers and biases in data series.

The live births were calculated by taking the infant population from the World Population Prospects: the 2012 revision (15) and adding back the deaths in the neonatal and post-neonatal periods while accounting for the fraction of period lived before the death.

These amounts are then averaged across all households (including those without any health expenditure) to get the overall average change in the poverty gap due to health spending.

These payments include the part not covered by a third party like an insurer but exclude insurance premiums. With this definition they correspond to out-of-pocket payments (OOPs - SHA 2011). The international poverty line of $1.90 a day is converted to local currency units (LCUs) using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPIs). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain the (increase) in the mean shortfall per person. If the sample is self-weighting then only the household size is used as the weight.\nThe 2011 PPP $1.90 a day poverty line updates the $1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 PPP. It is often referred to as the \u201cextreme poverty line\u201d and underlies SDG target 1.1. With this poverty line the increase in the poverty gap due to out-of-pocket payments is close to or equal to zero in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty gaps at national and regional levels.\nThis indicator is not an official SDG indicator per se but links SDG goal 3.8 on Universal health coverage directly to the first SDG goal on poverty eradication. It is an important complement to SDG indicator 3.8.2. To fully understand progress towards UHC it needs to be monitored jointly with SDG indicator 3.8.1.",
  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_PG_310_STD": "Definition: The increase in poverty gap due to household health expenditures corresponds to the increase in the mean shortfall of the total population from the international poverty line attributable to household health expenditures (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall). The increase in the mean shortfall is expressed as a percentage of the international poverty line. The international poverty line of 3.20 a day per capita in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) is used (shown as $3.20 a day).\n\nMethod of estimation: Let\u2019s refer to household total consumption inclusive of household health spending as \u201cgross consumption\u201d and to household total consumption excluding household health spending as \u201cnet consumption\u201d. If income is used let\u2019s refer to \u201cnet income\u201d as household income less household expenditures on health and to \u201cgross income\u201d as household total income. Consumption is the preferred welfare measure and income should be only when consumption data is unavailable. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party like an insurer but exclude insurance premiums. With this definition Household expenditure on health correspond to out-of-pocket payments (OOPs - SHA 2011). With these definitions, the increase in the poverty gap due to household health expenditures is computed as the poverty gap based on \u201cnet consumption\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d less the poverty gap based on \u201cgross consumption\u201d or \u201cgross income\u201d. The poverty gap always corresponds to the mean shortfall in consumption (gross/net) or income (gross/net) from the poverty line (counting the nonpoor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. Differences in poverty gaps as defined here reflect then the increase in the mean shortfall in consumption or income due to household expenditures on health. The poverty gap always captures the depth of poverty as well as its incidence at the poverty line, hence difference in poverty gaps as defined here reflect both changes in the incidence of poverty due to household expenditures on health and changes in the depth of poverty due to health spending. The international poverty line of $3.20 a day is converted to local currency units (LCUs) using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPIs). The $3.20 a day poverty line replaces the $3.10 a day poverty line used in the 2017 release of the data following the World Bank 2018 revision of the higher standards used to monitor global poverty. The 2011 PPP $3.20 a day poverty line corresponds to the median national poverty line of lower middle-income countries. With this poverty line the increase in the poverty gap due to out-of-pocket payments is close to or equal to zero in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty gaps at national and regional levels. This indicator is not an official SDG indicator per se but links SDG goal 3.8 on Universal health coverage directly to the first SDG goal on poverty eradication.

  "FINPROTECTION_IMPOV_ESTIMATE_AVAILABLE": "Definition: Proportion of the population where a household\u2019s total expenditure or income including household expenditure on health is at or above the international poverty line but the household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income excluding household expenditure on health is below the international poverty line. The international poverty line of 1.90 a day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) is used (shown as $1.90 a day) to demonstrate the interdependency between SDG target 1.1 the eradication of extreme poverty and SDG target 3.8 (universal coverage).\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed below an international poverty line by household health expenditures ( impoverished by health expenditures) is computed as the difference in the incidence of poverty based on household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income gross and net of health expenditures. Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). The international poverty line of $1.90 a day is converted to local currency units (LCUs) using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPIs). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishment due to spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage (UHC) per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. For global monitoring international poverty lines are used. The 1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPP updates the 1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 PPP and is often referred to as the \u201cextreme poverty line\u201d which underlies SDG target 1.1. With this poverty line the proportion of the population pushed into poverty by out-of-pocket payments are close to or equal to zero in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels. The total population incurring impoverishing health expenditures correspond to those pushed and pushed further into poverty by out-of-pocket health spending.

This indicator assesses the progress in providing antiretroviral combination therapy to all people with\u00a0 HIV infection. As the HIV epidemic matures, increasing numbers of people are reaching advanced stages of HIV infection. Over recent years WHO has issued various updates in the ARV guidelines. Under the 2013 WHO consolidated guidelines, roughly 85% people living with HIV would be eligible for treatment in 2013. For reasons of comparibility across countries and over time in the context of changing recommendations, this indicator relates to the number of people receiving ART as of proportion of the overall estimated number of people living with HIV.\u00a0 The ranges around the levels of people living with HIV who received ART are based on the uncertainty bounds around the estimates of people living with HIV.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of adults and children with HIV infection currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocols (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) among the estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\nNumerator: Number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period.\nDenominator: Estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\n\nMethod of measurement: Numerator:\u00a0The number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy can be obtained through data collected from facility-based antiretroviral therapy registers or drug supply management systems. These are then tallied and transferred to cross-sectional monthly or quarterly reports which can then be aggregated for national totals. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in the private sector and public sector should be included in the numerator where data are available. Antiretroviral therapy taken only for the purpose of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis are not included in this indicator. HIV-infected pregnant women who are eligible for antiretroviral therapy and on antiretroviral therapy for their own treatment are included in this indicator.\nDenominator: The denominator is generated by estimating the number of people with\u00a0 HIV infection. A standard modelling method is recommended. The Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)* and Spectrum*, softwares have been developed by the UNAIDS/WHO Reference Group on Estimates, Models and Projections.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF are responsible for reporting data for this indicator at the international level, and have been compiling country specific data since 2003.Predominant type of statistics: predicted\nNumerator: The data on people receiving antiretroviral therapy are collected through a joint joint international monitoring and reporting process\u00a0 with WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat.\u00a0 For this purpose a joint data tool has been developed that contains Global AIDS Progress Reporting (GARPR) indicators -- before 2012 known as UNGASS indicators -- as well as as well additional WHO/UNICEF Universal Access Health Sector indicators. Data are also compiled from the most recent reports received by WHO and/or UNAIDS from health ministries or from other reliable sources in the countries, such as bilateral partners, foundations and nongovernmental organizations that are major providers of treatment services.\u00a0In order to facilitate collaboration at country level, the country offices of WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat, work jointly with national counterparts and partner agencies to collate and validate data in a single collaborative consultation process.\nIn addition, at least twice a year, international data reconciliation meetings are organized to review and validate data reported to WHO, UNICEF, the UNAIDS Secretariat, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Where discrepancies are identified between data reported to the different organizations, follow-up letters are sent to UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO country offices in order to liaise with national authorities to seek clarification and resolve discrepancies.\nThe estimates of antiretroviral therapy coverage presented here are calculated by dividing the estimated number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy as of December by the number of people estimated to need treatment in same year (based on UNAIDS/WHO methods).",

  "MCV2": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of children who have received two doses of measles containing vaccine (MCV2) in a given year, according to the nationally recommended schedule.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as percentage of children who received the 2nd dose of measles containing vaccine according to the nationally recommended schedule.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\nThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events. When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",
  "MDG_0000000001": "Rationale: Infant mortality represents an important component of under-five mortality. Like under-five mortality, infant mortality rates measure child survival. They also reflect the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. Since data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases (morbidity data) frequently are unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. Infant mortality rate is an MDG indicator.\n\nDefinition: Infant mortality rate is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of one, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.\nInfant mortality rate is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1000 live births.\n\nMethod of measurement: Most frequently used methods using the above-mentioned data sources are as follows:\n\u2022\u00a0Civil registration: Number of deaths at age 0 and population for the same age are used to calculate death rate which are then converted into age-specific probability of dying.\n\u2022\u00a0Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever born and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of infant mortality.\n\u2022\u00a0Surveys: A direct method is used based on birth history - a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. To reduce sampling errors, the estimates are generally presented as period rates, for five or 10 years preceding the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: The Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality of Estimation (UN\u00a0IGME) which includes representatives from UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division,\u00a0produces trends of infant mortality rates with standardized methodology by group of countries depending on the type and quality of source of data available.\u00a0\nFor countries with adequate trend of data from civil registration, the calculations of\u00a0under-five\u00a0and infant mortality rates are\u00a0derived from a standard period abridged life table.\n\u00a0\nFor countries with survey data, since infant mortality rates from birth histories of surveys are exposed to recall biases, infant mortality is derived from the projection of under-five mortality rates converted into infant mortality rates using the Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThese infant mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to all Member States to the available data from Member States, that aim to ensure comparability of across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.\n\u00a0\nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and predicted.",
  "MDG_0000000003": "Rationale: Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving\nsexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socioeconomic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.\n\nDefinition: The annual number of births to women aged 15-19 years per 1,000 women in that age group. It is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.\n\nMethod of measurement: The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.\nIn the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth\nhistories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a\nreference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15\nand 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation\nyear corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective\nbirth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number\nof births in the 12 months preceding the survey.\nWith census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the\nnumber of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator\nand the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for underregistration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the\nown-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number\nof years before the census.\nFor a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of\nFertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11,\n(http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf). Indirect methods of estimation are\nanalyzed in Manual X: Indirect Techniques for Demographic Estimation, United Nations Publication, Sales\nNo. E.83.XIII.2. (http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/Manual_X/Manual_X.htm).\n\nMethod of estimation: For civil registration data, data on births or the adolescent birth rate are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). The population figures are obtained from the last revision of the United Nations Population Division World Population Prospects and only exceptionally from other sources. Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated\u2014such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)\u2014and other nationally-sponsored surveys. Other national surveys conducted as part of the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) or the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) may be considered as well. The data are taken from published survey reports or, in exceptional cases, other published analytical reports. Whenever the estimates are available in the survey report, they are directly taken from it. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which occasionally may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response.

  "MDG_0000000026": "Rationale: In 2015, in anticipation of the launch of the SDGs, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners released a consensus statement and full strategy paper on ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM).The EPMM target for reducing the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by 2030 was adopted as SDG target 3.1: reduce global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 live births by 2030.\nWHO leads the UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group (MMEIG) composed of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division, and the World Bank Group. The MMEIG is tasked with generating internationally comparable estimates of maternal mortality for the purposes of global monitoring, having done so for Millennium Development Goal reporting and will continue to do under the Sustainable Development Goals framework.\nMonitoring maternal health is widely seen as one of the most complicated health indicators within global frameworks. Significant unfinished business and challenges remain with estimating MMR; primarily due to the availability and usability of population based data on maternal death.\n\nDefinition: The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.\nMaternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.\nLive birth : The complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. (ICD-10)\nInternational reporting of maternal mortality\nFor the purpose of international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates.\nThe recording of later deaths is encouraged to inform national, regional, and global understanding of these events\n\nMethod of measurement: The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\nMaternal mortality ratio = (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) X 100,000\nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. However, there are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take into account these data quality issues. Adjustments for underreporting and misclassification of deaths and model-based estimates should be made in the cases where data are not reliable.\nBecause maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or overtime comparisons.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and MICS (round 4 and 5) surveys measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth, or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.\nReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these are maternal or pregnancy-related.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, UNPD, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. Data available from countries varies in terms of the source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. The current methodology employed by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) in this round followed an improved approach that built directly upon methods used to produce the 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015 maternal mortality estimates. Estimates for this round were generated using a Bayesian approach, referred to as the Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, or BMat model. This enhanced methodology uses the same core estimation method as in those previous rounds, but adds refinements to optimize the use of country-specific data sources and excludes late maternal deaths. It therefore provides more accurate estimates, and a more realistic assessment of certainty about those estimates. The new model still incorporates the same covariates which are; the Gross Domestic Product per capita based on purchasing power parity conversion (GDP), the general fertility rate (GFR), and proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker (SAB). The MMEIG has developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for underreporting and, where necessary, adjustment for incompleteness and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data. Predominant type of statistics: predicted\n\nMethod of measurement: The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. Maternal mortality ratio = (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) X 100,000 The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. However, there are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take into account these data quality issues. Adjustments for underreporting and misclassification of deaths and model-based estimates should be made in the cases where data are not reliable. Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or overtime comparisons. To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and MICS surveys measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth, or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these are maternal or pregnancy-related.",
  "MDG_0000000029": "Rationale: HIV and AIDS has become a major public health problem in many countries and monitoring the course of the epidemic and impact of interventions is crucial. Both the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS (UNGASS) have set goals of reducing HIV prevalence.\n\nDefinition: The estimated number of adults aged 15-49 years with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed symptoms of AIDS, expressed as per cent of total population in that age group.\n\nMethod of measurement: Standardized tools and methods of estimation have been developed by UNAIDS and WHO in collaboration with the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimation, Modelling and Projections.\n\u00a0\nIn countries with a generalized epidemic, national estimates of HIV prevalence are based on data generated by surveillance systems that focus on pregnant women who attend a selected number of sentinel antenatal clinics, and in an increasing number of countries on nationally representative serosurveys. In countries with a low level or concentrated epidemic national estimates of HIV prevalence are primarily based on surveillance data collected from populations at high risk (sex workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users) and estimates of the size of populations at high and low risk. This data is entered into the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) software\u00a0 which fits a simple epidemiological model to the epidemic structure defined. EPP finds the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over time, and calibrates that curve based on prevalence found in any national surveys or default values in case there is no national survey available.\nFor countries with very little available prevalence data (less than three consistent surveillance sites) a point prevalence estimate and projection is made using spreadsheet models (the Workbook Method). The resulting point prevalence estimates for several years are entered into EPP to find the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over time.\n\u00a0\n(http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/Methodology/ , accessed on 2 may 2010)\n\nMethod of estimation: The country-specific estimates of adults living with HIV, used as the numerator for this indicator, have been produced by National AIDS Programs and compiled by UNAIDS and WHO. They have been discussed\u00a0 with national AIDS programs for review and comments, but are not necessarily the official estimates used by national governments. For countries where no recent data were available, country-specific estimates have not been listed in the tables.

In addition to the obvious benefit to individual patients, successful treatment of infectious cases of TB is essential to prevent the spread of the infection.\nDetecting and successfully treating a large proportion of TB cases should have an immediate impact on TB prevalence and mortality. By reducing transmission, successfully treating the majority of cases will also affect, with some delay, the incidence of disease.\nIndicator 6.10 of the Millenium development Goal is the \"proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under DOTS\".\nThe Stop TB\u00a0Partnership's Global Plan to Stop TB 2011 - 2015 has set a target of smear-positive treatment success rate of 90%.\n\nDefinition: The proportion of new smear-positive TB cases registered under a national TB control programme in a given year that successfully completed treatment, whether with or without bacteriological evidence of success (\u201ccured\u201d or \u201ctreatment completed\u201d respectively).\nAt the end of treatment, each patient is assigned one of the following six mutually exclusive treatment outcomes: cured; completed; died; failed; defaulted; and transferred out with outcome unknown. The proportions of cases assigned to these outcomes, plus any additional cases registered for treatment but not assigned to an outcome, add up to 100% of cases registered.\n\nMethod of measurement: Treatment success rates are calculated from cohort data (outcomes in registered patients) as the proportion of new smear-positive TB cases registered under a national TB control programme in a given year that successfully completed treatment, whether with (\u201ccured\u201d) or without (\u201ctreatment completed\u201d) bacteriologic evidence of success.\nThe treatment outcomes of TB cases registered for treatment are reported annually by countries to WHO using a web-based data collection system. See the WHO global tuberculosis control report.\nThe treatment outcomes of TB cases reported by countries follow the WHO recommendations on definitions of outcomes, they are internationally comparable and there is no need for any adjustment.\nBecause treatment for TB lasts 6\u20138 months, there is a delay in assessing treatment outcomes. Each year, national TB control programmes report to WHO the number of cases of TB diagnosed in the preceding year, and the outcomes of treatment for the cohort of patients who started treatment a year earlier.",

  "MORT_MATERNALNUM": "Definition: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy.\n\nMethod of measurement: Recorded or estimated number of maternal deaths. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, UNPD, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. Data available from countries varies in terms of the source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. The current methodology employed by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) in this round followed an improved approach that built directly upon methods used to produce the 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015 maternal mortality estimates. Estimates for this round were generated using a Bayesian approach, referred to as the Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, or BMat model. This enhanced methodology uses the same core estimation method as in those previous rounds, but adds refinements to optimize the use of country-specific data sources and excludes late maternal deaths. It therefore provides more accurate estimates, and a more realistic assessment of certainty about those estimates. The new model still incorporates the same covariates which are; the Gross Domestic Product per capita based on purchasing power parity conversion (GDP), the general fertility rate (GFR), and proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker (SAB)). The MMEIG has developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for underreporting and, where necessary, adjustment for incompleteness and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.

  "NUTRITION_570": "Rationale: Early initiation of breastfeeding, within one hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infection and reduces newborn mortality. It facilitates emotional bonding of the mother and the baby and has a positive impact on duration of exclusive breastfeeding. When a mother initiates breastfeeding within one hour after birth, production of breast milk is stimulated.

Exclusive breastfeeding is the single most effective intervention to improve the survival of children. Improving infant and young child feeding practices is therefore critical to improved nutrition, health and development of children.\n\nDefinition: Proportion of infants 0\u20135 months of age (0 to < 6 months) who are fed exclusively with breast milk.\n\nMethod of measurement: Percentage of infants 0\u20135 months of age who are fed exclusively with breast milk = (Infants 0\u20135 months of age who received only breast milk during the previous day/Infants 0\u20135 months of age) x 100\u00a0.\n\u00a0\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) include questions on liquids and foods given the previous day, and number of milk feeds the previous day, to learn if the child is being exclusively breastfed.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO and UNICEF jointly collect data on infant and young child feeding, pooling information from national surveys. The WHO Programme of Nutrition, Physical Activity adn Obesity, at the Regional Office for Europe compiles country information on exclusive breastfeeding independently. Note, many developed country data refer to exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, which provides lower estimates than the standard measure of exclusive breastfeeding averaged over the first six months.

DALYs, by the total population.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to selected occupational risks is linked with a range of conditions. Of these, evidence for the following have been assessed on sufficiently strong basis for inclusion in the burden of disease estimates:\n1. Occupational carcinogens:\nTrachea, bronchus, lung cancers\nLeukemia\nOther malignants neoplasms\n2.

  "P_Group": "Rationale: In 2008, WHO introduced the MPOWER package to assist in the country-level implementation of six effective measures to reduce demand for tobacco products.\u00a0 Each measure reflects at least one provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\u00a0 The letter P in MPOWER denotes the \"Protect from tobacco smoke\" measure. Second-hand tobacco smoke is present in virtually all public places where smoking is permitted, and there is no safe level of exposure. Breathing secondhand tobacco smoke has serious and often fatal health consequences. Globally, it is estimated that about one third of adults are regularly exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. 100% smoke-free environments are the only proven way to adequately protect the health of people from the harmful effects of secondhand tobacco smoke. This indicator measures the implementation status of the P measure.\n\nDefinition: Country's legislation is assessed to determine whether smoke-free laws exist in each of the following places at either the national or subnational level:\n\u2022 health-care facilities;\n\u2022 educational facilities other than universities;\n\u2022 universities;\n\u2022 government facilities;\n\u2022 indoor offices;\n\u2022 restaurants;\n\u2022 pubs and bars;\n\u2022 public transport.\nThe implementation status of the Smoke-free environments measure was classified by grouping countries into five groups.\nThe groupings for this indicator are:\n1 = Data not reported/not categorized*\n2 = Up to two public places completely smoke-free\n3 = Three to five public places completely smoke-free\n4 = Six to seven public places completely smoke-free\n6 = All public places completely smoke-free (or at least 90% of the population covered by complete subnational smoke-free legislation)\n*In several countries, in order to significantly expand the creation of smoke-free places, including restaurants and bars, it was politically necessary to include exceptions to the law that allowed for the provision of designated smoking rooms. The requirements for designated smoking rooms are so technically complex and stringent that, for practical purposes, few or no establishments are expected to implement them. Because no data were requested on the number of complex designated smoking rooms actually constructed, it is not possible to know whether these laws have resulted in the complete absence of such rooms, as intended. For this reason, these few countries have not been categorized in the analyses for this indicator.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO assessment of country's legislative documents",

  "PC_sfe_compliance": "Definition: The level of compliance with the law was measured by asking in-country experts to provide their assessments by interview. These experts included at least three, and up to five, of the following persons:\n\u2022 the most senior government official in charge of tobacco control or tobacco-related conditions;\n\u2022 the head of a prominent NGO dedicated to tobacco control;\n\u2022 a health professional (e.g. physician, nurse, pharmacist) specializing in tobacco-related conditions;\n\u2022 a staff member of a public health university department;\n\u2022 the Tobacco Free Initiative focal point at the WHO country office.\nAssessments were requested for each provision which is in place under a national law banning smoking in public places and enclosed workplaces. Provisions not in place, or provisions put in place too recently to assess, were excluded from the request. An assessment of overall compliance with the law (all provisions considered together) was also requested.\nThe provisions of interest for assessing compliance with smoke-free environment laws are:\n1. A complete ban on smoking in health care facilities\n2. A complete ban on smoking in educational facilities (excluding universities)\n3. A complete ban on smoking in universities\n4. A complete ban on smoking in government facilities\n5. A complete ban on smoking in indoor private offices and workplaces\n6. A complete ban on smoking in restaurants\n7. A complete ban on smoking in pubs and bars\n8. A complete ban on smoking in public transport.\nA compliance score of 0-10 was calculated based on the average responses of the 3-5 experts. If all experts said compliance was \"high\", a score of 10 was achieved. If all experts said compliance was \"minimal\", this resulted in a score of zero. A mix of high, moderate and minimal responses resulted in an average score calculated out of 10. Missing responses were scored as \"missing\" unless there were at least 3 non-missing responses given.\n\nMethod of estimation: Country reported data.",
  "PCV3": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV3) in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections. Household surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated percentage of surviving infants who received the 3rd dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In countries where the national schedule recommends two doses during infancy and a booster dose at 12 months or later based on the epidemiology of disease in the country, coverage estimates may reflect the percentage of surviving infants who received two doses of PCV prior to the 1st birthday.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\nThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events. When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",

A reactive non-treponemal test, particularly if the titre is > 1:8, is suggestive of active infection, whereas positivity with a treponemal test indicates any previous infection even if treated successfully. For the purposes of this indicator (intended to measure seropositivity), it is acceptable to report positivity based on a single test result. If both treponemal and non-treponemal test results on an individual patient are available, then syphilis positivity should be defined as having positive results on both tests.

The requirement for both a positive non-treponemal test and a positive treponemal test in MSM differs from the indicator on syphilis testing in antenatal care attendees because MSM are more likely to have a history of previous infection.

  "R_Ad_val_average": "Rationale: This information can be used to assess the affordability of tobacco products, as well as to calculate the share of taxes in the price of a cigarette pack.\n\nDefinition: The ad valorem excise tax imposed on cigarettes is converted to a percentage of each of the three most sold brands of cigarettes in a country. An average of the three proportions is then calculated weighted by the market share of each of the three brands.\nWHO uses the information provided on tax policy in order to calculate the share of tobacco taxes on the most widely sold brand of cigarettes in the country. This indicator takes into account the exact contribution of all taxes in the price of a cigarette pack and therefore represents the best comparable measure of the magnitude of tobacco taxes.\nAn ad valorem excise tax is a tax on a selected good produced for sale within a country, or imported and sold in that country. In general, the tax is collected from the manufacturer/wholesaler or at the point of entry into the country by the importer, in addition to import duties. These taxes come in the form of a percentage of the value of a transaction between two independent entities at some point of the production/distribution chain; ad valorem taxes are generally applied to the value of the transactions between the manufacturer and the retailer/wholesaler. Example: 27% of the retail price.\n\nMethod of estimation: All tax rates are recalculated to the same base, the tax inclusive retail sales price. Consider the example where Country B applies the same ad valorem tax as Country A, but ends up with higher taxation because the tax is applied later in the distribution chain. Comparing ad valorem tax rates without taking into account the stage at which the tax is applied could therefore lead to biased results.\nCalculation Sts is the share of taxes on the price of a widely consumed brand of cigarettes(20-cigarette pack or equivalent).\nSts = Sas + Sav + Sid + SVAT\nWhere: Sts = Total share of taxes on the price of a pack of cigarettes;\nSas = Share of amount-specific excise taxes (or equivalent) on the price of a pack of cigarettes;\nSav = Share of ad valorem excise taxes (or equivalent) on the price of a pack of cigarettes;\nSid = Share of import duties on the price of a pack of cigarettes (if the most popular brand is imported);\nSVAT = Share of the value added tax on the price of a pack of cigarettes.\nSas is calculated by dividing the amount for a 20-cigarette pack by the total price. Unlike Sas, Sav (the share of ad valorem taxes) is much more difficult to calculate and involves making some assumptions (see Technical Note III of the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2009). Sid is sometimes amount-specific, sometimes value-based. It is therefore calculated the same way as Sas if it is amount-specific and the same way as Sav if it is value-based.

Only the price of the most popular brand of cigarettes is considered. In the case of countries where different levels of taxes applied to cigarettes are based on either length, quantity produced or type (e.g. filter vs. non-filter), only the rate that applied to the most popular brand is used in the calculation.\nGiven the lack of information on country and brand-specific profit margins of retailers and wholesalers, their profits were assumed to be zero (unless provided by the national data collector).\u00a0 The implementation status of the Raise tobacco taxes measure was classified by grouping countries into five groups.\nThe groupings for this indicator are:\n1 = Data not reported\n2 = \u2264 25% of retail price is tax\n3 = 26\u201350% of retail price is tax\n4 = 51\u201375% of retail price is tax\n5 = >75% of retail price is tax.\n\nMethod of estimation: Country reported data, assessed according to the definition of this indicator.",

Unlike Sas, Sav (the share of ad valorem taxes) is much more difficult to calculate and involves making some assumptions (see Technical Note III of the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2009). Sid is sometimes amount-specific, sometimes value-based. It is therefore calculated the same way as Sas if it is amount-specific and the same way as Sav if it is value-based. SVAT is usually applied at the end of the taxation process, either on the VAT-exclusive or inclusive retail sales price.",

  "ROTAC": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of surviving infants who received the final recommended dose of rotavirus vaccine,\nwhich can be either the 2nd or the 3rd dose depending on the vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of surviving infants who received the final recommended dose of rotavirus vaccine, which can be either the 2nd or the 3rd dose depending on the vaccine.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\nThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events. When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",

One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u201chealthy\u201d life and the burden of disease as a measurement of the gap between the current health of a population and an ideal situation where everyone in the population lives into old age in full health. DALYS for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders\u00a0include age-weighting and time discounting. 3% discounting and non-uniform age weighting was used, resulting in less weight given to years lived at young and older ages.\n\nMethod of estimation: See Global Burden of Disease study, 2004.",

  "SA_0000001398": "Rationale: The recorded alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is part of a core set of indicators, whose purpose is to monitor the magnitude, pattern and trends of alcohol consumption in the adult population (15 years of age and older).\nDrinking alcohol can be associated with developing alcohol use disorder or dependence and higher risk of mental and behavioural disorders. It is a major risk for liver cirrhosis, some cancers and cardiovascular diseases as well as injuries resulting from violence and accidents.\nBeyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals, their families and society at large.\n\nDefinition: Recorded APC is defined as the recorded amount of alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) over a calendar year in a country, in litres of pure alcohol. The indicator only takes into account the consumption which is recorded from production, import, export, and sales data often via taxation. Numerator: The amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol.

The estimates for the total alcohol consumption are produced by summing up the 3-year average per capita (15+) recorded alcohol consumption and an estimate of per capita (15+) unrecorded alcohol consumption for a calendar year. Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries.\n\nMethod of measurement: Recorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol consumed according to the official statistics at country level based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation data. When government national statistics are not available, country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or fieldwork are used; otherwise, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT) are used, or data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review.\nUnrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). When nationally representative empirical data (which are often general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal) are not available, specific other empirical investigations, or expert opinion supported by periodic surveys of experts at country level using modified Delphi-technique, are used.\nThe litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age or older) in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years or older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assumes the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive).Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME.\n\nMethod of estimation: The total APC in 2016 was calculated from a three-year average of recorded (for 2015, 2016, and 2017) per capita consumption and applying unrecorded proportion (for 2016) and tourist consumption (for 2016).\nFor recorded alcohol consumption, if data did not already exist for 2015, 2016 and/or 2017, the relevant years were projected using a linear regression model employing recorded alcohol per capita consumption data since 2012.\nUnrecorded alcohol consumption was estimated as a percentage of total alcohol consumption. Country-level proportions of unrecorded alcohol consumption were estimated using a regression analysis. Fractional response random intercepts regression models which accounted for clustering of data points within countries were used to estimate what percentage of total alcohol consumption was due to unrecorded alcohol consumption. Univariate models were fitted for alcohol consumption statistics (the prevalence of drinking, recorded litres of alcohol consumed per capita per year, patterns of drinking scores, value added and excise taxation of alcoholic beverages, presence of a written national alcohol policy, presence of national legislation to prevent illegal production and/or the sale of home or informally produced alcoholic beverages, and alcohol prohibition measures) and other predictors (urbanization, migration rates, malnutrition, sanitation, education levels, and per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity). Backward and forward selection (using a significance cut-off level of 0.2) was used in combination with out-of-sample predictions (multiple random 10% sub-samples) and plausibility checks to assess model fit. Covariate data for 2016 were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Bank.\nTourist consumption of alcohol are the litres of pure alcohol which are purchased and consumed by tourists to a country.

Denominator: Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant.\n\nMethod of measurement: Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other) from different sources: the first priority in the decision tree is given to government statistics; second are country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or field work (GlobalData (formerly Canadean), IWSR-International Wine and Spirit Research, Wine Institute, historically World Drink Trends), or data from the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV); third is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT); and fourth is data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review. For countries, where the data source is FAOSTAT the unrecorded consumption may be included in the recorded consumption. As from the introduction of the \"Other\" beverage-specific category, beer includes malt beers, wine includes wine made from grapes, spirits include all distilled beverages, and other includes one or several other alcoholic beverages, such as fermented beverages made from sorghum, maize, millet, rice, or cider, fruit wine, fortified wine.\n\nMethod of estimation: Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other). In order to make the conversion into litres of pure alcohol, if beverage volumes are not available in litres of pure alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%).",

In order to better understand alcohol consumption, we need to combine this information with other information on who drinks and in what pattern. The number of alcohol consumers in the past 12 months provides such information by separating out the drinking from the non-drinking population.\n\nDefinition: Alcohol consumers in the past 12 months is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have consumed any alcohol during the past 12 months, assessed at a given point in time. The indicator is calculated with the help of the indicator \"Abstainers (15+ years), past 12 months\" by using 1-abstainers.\n\nMethod of measurement: A representative sample of the adult population (15+ years) of the country is asked to answer questions in a survey.

It is a major risk for liver cirrhosis, some cancers and cardiovascular diseases as well as injuries resulting from violence and accidents.\nBeyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings significant social and economic losses to individuals, their families and society at large.\n\nDefinition: Total APC is defined as the total (sum of three-year average recorded and three-year average unrecorded APC, adjusted for three-year average tourist consumption) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol.

The prevalence of this condition in a given population is therefore useful in establishing the relative level of the number of individuals dying from heavy alcohol use. Alcohol is a frequent contributor to cancer and fatal road traffic crashes.\nThese are therefore important in evaluating, in an indirect way, alcohol-related mortalities and health outcomes generally.\n\nDefinition: The age-standardized death rate for these conditions is defined as the number of individuals in a given population who died from cancer, liver cirrhosis or road traffic crashes, respectively (codes according to ICD-10), during a calendar year. Death rates are age-standardized by the WHO standard population.\nNumerator:\nThe total number of deaths from the respective condition as mentioned above during a calendar year, among the country's population.\nDenominator:\nWhenever available, population data as provided by the countries; in the absence of reported population data, the estimated population data prepared by the United Nations Population Division are used.\n\nMethod of estimation: The numbers of deaths per 100,000 population are influenced by the age\ndistribution of the population. Two populations with the same age-specific mortality rates for a particular cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their populations are different. Age-standardized mortality rates adjust for differences in the age distribution of the population by applying the observed age-specific mortality rates for each population to a standard population. Hence the age standardized mortality rate is a weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates per 100,000 persons, where the weights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age group of the WHO standard population. Age-standardized death rates were calculated for population 15 years and over.",

For example if the purpose is to estimate national childhood hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission (including mother-to-child transmission) then the sampling should be geographically representative of the population. Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of \u00b1 0.5%. The target age is 5-years-old. Sampling 4\u20136 year olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred. Data on HepB birth dose exposure and HepB3 completion should be drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology. When an appropriate sampling strategy and size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures are employed, the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region (or country) in this age group.\n\nMethod of estimation: HBsAg is the most important input into estimation of Hepatitis B incidence which is defined as number of new hepatitis B infections per 100 000 population in a given year.

The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation.\nThis number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention \u2013 that is, treatment and care for NTDs.\n\nDefinition: Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO.\n\nMethod of estimation: Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an agreed international standard. [http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8702.pdf?ua=1]\n1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced.\n2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available.\nPopulations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach.",

  "SDGWSHBOD": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to water, sanitation and hygiene was assessed, focusing on unsafe WASH services. The share of population using safely managed water and sanitation services are addressed in Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. In low-income countries, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene are important risks to health.\n\nDefinition: Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 100,000 population. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population. Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene habits is, among others, directly linked to diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal nematode infections and other diseases. Repeated diarrhoea episodes are linked to protein-energy malnutrition. In this estimate, only the impact of diarrhoeal diseases, intestinal nematode infections, and protein-energy malnutrition are taken into account. The included diseases are the WASH attributable portions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10 code B76-B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46).\n\nMethod of estimation: Attributable diarrhoea deaths are calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the percentage of the population with exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and lack of hygiene). This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case lack of access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene. Applying this fraction to the total deaths from diarrhoea results in the number of diarrhoea deaths that results from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene. Deaths from protein-energy malnutrition attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene are estimated by evaluating the impacts of repeated infectious diarrhoea episodes on nutritional status (in particular stunting). All deaths from intestinal nematode infections are attributed to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene due to their transmission pathway.\nThe methods with agreed international standard have been developed, reviewed and published in various documents: http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/gbd_poor_water/en/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255749/",

Since then there has been\u00a0\nconsiderable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys.\u00a0\nThe World Bank's Development Research Group maintain\ns a database that is updated annually as new\u00a0\nsurvey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major\u00a0\nreassessment of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that\u00a0\nall\nows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day global, regional and\u00a0\ncountry\n-\nlevel poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for\u00a0\ndifferent poverty lines.\u00a0\nThe Poverty and Equity Data p\nortal provides access to the database and user\n-\nfriendly dashboards with\u00a0\ngraphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different\u00a0\nregions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measure\ns based on the national\u00a0\npoverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent with PovcalNet.\n\nDefinition: The indicator Proportion of population below the international poverty line is defined as\u00a0the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. The 'international poverty line' is currently set at $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data are taken from the United Nations' SDG Indicators Global Database. See links below for \u00a0more information.\nTo measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank\u2019s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what \u201cpoverty\u201d means in the world\u2019s poorest countries.\u00a0\nThe current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption.\u00a0\nWhen measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI).\u00a0\n(Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year,\u00a0\nand then converted to PPP $\u2019s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI.

Cases where the perpetrator was merely reckless or negligent should be excluded.\n\nMethod of estimation: The estimates of homicide numbers draw on data provided by countries from police and vital registration sources; data from UNODC\u2019s global Studies on homicide; and data from WHO\u2019s Mortality Database. The estimation process used observed data on homicide rates, in conjunction with regression modelling for countries without sufficient data availability or quality, to compute comparable estimates of homicide rates and numbers across countries.",

  "W_Group": "Rationale: .In 2008, WHO introduced the MPOWER package to assist in the country-level implementation of six effective measures to reduce demand for tobacco products.\u00a0 Each measure reflects at least one provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\u00a0 The letter W in MPOWER denotes the \"Warn about the dangers of tobacco\" measure. Despite conclusive evidence regarding the dangers of tobacco, relatively few tobacco users worldwide understand the full extent of the risk to their health. Prominent warning labels on tobacco product packaging provide the most direct health messages to all smokers, as well as to non-smokers who see the packs. Warning labels encourage smokers to quit and discourage nonsmokers from starting, are well accepted by the public, and can be implemented at virtually no cost to governments. This indicator measures the implementation status of the W measure regarding legislation mandating health warnings on tobacco product packaging.\n\nDefinition: Country's legislation is assessed to determine whether\u00a0health warnings with specific criteria are mandated.\nThe groupings for this indicator are:\n1 = Data not reported\n2 = No warning or warning covering <30% of pack surface\n3 = \u226530%* but no pictures or pictograms and/or other appropriate characteristics**\n4 = 31%\u201349%* including pictures or pictograms and other appropriate characteristics**\n5 = \u226550%* including pictures or pictograms and appropriate characteristics**\n* average of the front and back of the cigarette pack.\n** \u2022 Specific health warnings mandated;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 appearing on individual packages as well as on any outside packaging and labelling used in retail sale;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 describing specific harmful effects of tobacco use on health;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 are large, clear, visible and legible (e.g. specific colours and font style and sizes are mandated);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 rotate;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 written in (all) principal language(s) of the country\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO assessment of country's legislative documents",

This system provides annual data.\n\u00a0\nData from household surveys: Calculations are based on full birth history, whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death\n\nMethod of estimation: To ensure consistency with mortality rates in children younger than 5 years (U5MR) produced for the United Nations by the Inter-agency Group for Mortality Estimation (IGME) and to account for variation in survey-to-survey measurement errors, country data points for U5MR and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) were rescaled for all years to match the latest time series estimates of U5MR produced by IGME. This rescaling assumes that the proportionate measurement error in NMR and U5MR is equal for each data point.\n\u00a0\nThe following multilevel statistical model was then applied to estimate neonatal mortality rates\n\u00a0\nlog(NMR/1000) = \u03b10+ \u03b21*log(U5MR/1000) + \u03b22*([log(U5MR/1000)]^2) \u00a0\nwith random effects parameters for both level and trend regression parameters, and random effects parameters influenced by country itself.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor countries with high quality civil registration data for neonatal deaths, defined as i) 100% complete for adults and only civil registration data is used for child mortality; ii) population greater than 800 000; iii) and with at least 3 civil registration data points for all the following calendar windows 1990-1994, 1995-1999, 2000-2004, 2005 onwards, we used the same basic equation, but with random effects parameters for both level and trend regression parameters, and random effects parameters influenced by country itself.\n\u00a0\nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and predicted\n\u00a0\n\u00a0These neonatal rates are estimates, derived from the estimated UN IGME neonatal rate and infant population from World Population Prospects to calculate the live births; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national statistics.\u00a0\nSee the estimation methods in the links section for more information.",

  "WHS2_152": "Definition: Estimated number of malaria deaths per 100 000 population at risk\n\nMethod of measurement: The number of deaths due to indigenously acquired malaria was reported by national malaria control programs to WHO. The number of malaria estimated cases per Plasmodium species was used to estimate deaths after applying a species-specific case fatality rates.\n\nMethod of estimation: The number of malaria deaths was estimated by one of two methods: i) For countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa: the number of deaths was estimated by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases by a fixed case fatality rate for each country, as described in the World malaria report 2008. This method was used for all countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa, where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems. A case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.40% was applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases, and a case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.06% was applied to the estimated number of P. vivax cases. For countries in the pre-elimination and elimination phases, and those with vital registration systems that reported more than 50% of all deaths (determined by comparing the number of reported deaths with those expected given a country\u2019s population size and crude deaths rate), the number of malaria deaths was derived from the number of reported deaths, adjusting for completeness of reporting. ii) For countries in Africa with a high proportion of deaths due to malaria: child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multi-cause model developed by the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Estimation Group which estimates causes of death for children aged 1\u201359 months. Mortality estimates were derived for eight causes of post-neonatal death (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, injuries, pertussis, tuberculosis and other disorders), causes arising in the neonatal period (prematurity, birth asphyxia and trauma, sepsis, and other conditions of the neonate) and other causes (e.g. malnutrition). Deaths due to measles, unknown causes and HIV/AIDS were estimated separately. The resulting cause-specific estimates were adjusted, country by country, to fit the estimated 1\u201359 month mortality envelopes (excluding HIV and measles deaths) for corresponding years. Estimated malaria parasite prevalence, was used as a covariate within the model. Deaths in those aged over 5 years were inferred from a relationship between levels of malaria mortality in different age groups and the intensity of malaria transmission; thus, the estimated malaria mortality rate in children aged under 5 years was used to infer malaria-specific mortality in older age groups.\nThe denominator is estimated, using official UN population and population at risk estimates for countries with sub-national endemicity.",

  "WHS4_100": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12\u201323 months who received three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine time before the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.\nWhen faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made.

  "WHS4_154": "Rationale: Antenatal care (ANC) coverage is an indicator of access and use of health care during pregnancy. The antenatal period presents opportunities for reaching pregnant women with interventions that may be vital to their health and wellbeing and that of their infants. Receiving antenatal care at least four times increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions during the antenatal period. This is one of the indicators in the Global Strategy for Women\u2019s, Children\u2019s and Adolescents\u2019 Health (2016-2030) Monitoring Framework, and one of the tracer indicators of health services for the universal health coverage (SDG indicator 3.8.1).\n\nDefinition: The percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times. Due to data limitations, it is not possible to determine the type of provider for each visit.\nNumerator: The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times.\nDenominator: Total number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period.\n\nMethod of measurement: The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times during pregnancy is expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period. (Number of women aged 15-49 attended at least four times during pregnancy by any provider for reasons related to the pregnancy/total number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth) *100. The ANC4+ indicator is based on a standard question that asks if and how many times the health of the woman was checked during pregnancy. Unlike antenatal care coverage (at least one visit), the indicator antenatal care coverage (at least four visits) includes care given by any provider, not just by skilled health personnel. This is because the key national level household surveys do not collect information on type of provider for each visit. Household surveys that can generate this indicator includes Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and other surveys based on similar methodologies. Registry/facility reporting system can be used where the coverage is high, usually in industrialized countries.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO compiles empirical data from nationally-representative household surveys . Before data are included into the global databases, WHO undertake a process of data verification that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions regarding estimates.",

Each measure reflects at least one provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The letter W in MPOWER denotes the \"Warn about the dangers of tobacco\" measure. The media play a key role in shaping tobacco-related knowledge, opinions, attitudes and behaviours, and can be extremely powerful in influencing both individuals and policy-makers regarding tobacco use and tobacco control issues. As a result, mass media anti-tobacco campaigns have become a key component of tobacco control programmes in countries. This indicator measures the implementation status of the W measure regarding anti-tobacco mass media campaigns.\n\nDefinition: The implementation status of the Anti-tobacco mass media measure was classified by grouping countries into five groups.

Access to improved drinking water sources and to improved sanitation services are Sustainable Development Indicators for Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.In low-income countries, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene are important risks to health\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to water, sanitation and hygiene can be expressed as :\nNumber of deaths\nDeath rate\nNumber of DALYs\nDALYs rate\nDisability -Adusted Life Years (or DALYs) are a summary measure of population health that combine (i) the years of life lost as a result of premature death and (ii) the years lived\u00a0 with a disease.\nDeath and DALY rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths, resp.

In this estimate, only the impact of diarrhoeal diseases is taken into account.\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the percentage of the population with exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and lack of hygiene).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case lack of access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. diarrhoeal diseases expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene.",
  "WSH_HYGIENE_BASIC": "Rationale: Hygiene has long-established links with public health, and the explicit reference to hygiene in the text of SDG target 6.2 represents increasing recognition of the importance of hygiene and its close links with sanitation. Hygiene is multi-faceted and can comprise many behaviours, including handwashing, menstrual hygiene and food hygiene. International consultations among WASH sector professionals identified handwashing with soap and water as a top priority in all settings, and also as a suitable indicator for national and global monitoring.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of population living in households that have a handwashing facility with soap and water at home. Handwashing facilities can consist of a sink with tap water, but can also include other devices that contain, transport or regulate the flow of water. Buckets with taps, tippy-taps and portable basins are all examples of handwashing facilities. Bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent and soapy water all count as soap for monitoring purposes.\n\nMethod of measurement: Household surveys routinely collect information on the availability of handwashing facilities in the home. In most cases, the enumerator asks to see the place where members of the household most often wash their hands. The enumerator then observes if water and soap are available at that place. Household-level responses, weighted by household size, are used to compute population coverage.\n\nMethod of estimation: The JMP assembles, reviews and assesses national data collected by statistics offices and other relevant institutions including sectoral authorities. Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population with handwashing facilities at home, as well as the proportion with handwashing facilities where soap and water were observed.\nSeparate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division.\nThe most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago. The JMP extrapolates regressions for two years beyond the last available data point. Beyond this point the estimates remain unchanged for up to four years unless coverage is below 0.5 per cent or above 99.5 per cent, in which case the line is extended indefinitely.\nFor more information see https://washdata.org/monitoring/methods/estimation-methods\nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and predicted",

  "MALARIA_ITN_COVERAGE": "Definition: Percentage of the population with at least one ITN within their household\n\nMethod of measurement: Estimates of ITN access were derived from a model developed by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP), using a two-stage process. First, a mechanism was designed for estimating net crop (i.e. the total number of ITNs in households in a country at a given time), taking into account inputs to the system (e.g. deliveries of ITNs to a country) and outputs (e.g. loss of ITNs from households). Second, empirical modelling was used to translate estimated net crops (i.e. total number of ITNs in a country) into resulting levels of access. The model incorporates data from three sources: 1) the number of ITNs delivered by manufacturers to countries, as provided to WHO by Milliner Global Associates; 2) the number of ITNs distributed within countries, as reported to WHO by NMPs; and 3) data from nationally representative household surveys from sub-Saharan Africa, since 2001.\n\nMethod of estimation: National ITN systems were represented using a discrete-time stock-and-flow model. Nets delivered to a country by manufacturers were modelled as first entering a \u201ccountry stock\u201d compartment (i.e. stored in-country but not yet distributed to households). Nets were then available from this stock for distribution to households by the NMP or through other distribution channels. To accommodate uncertainty in net distribution, the number of nets distributed in a given year was specified as a range, with all available country stock (i.e. the maximum number of nets that could be delivered) as the upper end of the range and the NMP-reported value (i.e. the assumed minimum distribution) as the lower end. The total household net crop comprised new nets reaching households plus older nets remaining from earlier times, with the duration of net retention by households governed by a loss function. However, rather than the loss function being fitted to a small external dataset, the loss function was fitted directly to the distribution and net crop data within the stock-and-flow model itself. Loss functions were fitted on a country-by-country basis, were allowed to vary through time, and were defined separately for conventional ITNs (cITNs) and LLINs. The fitted loss functions were compared with existing assumptions about rates of net loss from households. The stock-and-flow model was fitted using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which provided time-series estimates of national household net crop for cITNs and LLINs in each country, and an evaluation of underdistribution, all with posterior credible intervals.\nRates of ITN access within households depend not only on the total number of ITNs in a country (i.e. the net crop), but also on how those nets are distributed among households. One factor that is known to strongly influence the relationship between net crop and net distribution patterns among households is the size of households, which varies among countries, particularly across sub-Saharan Africa. Many recent national surveys report the number of ITNs observed in each household surveyed. Hence, it is possible not only to estimate net crop, but also to generate a histogram that summarizes the household net ownership pattern (i.e. the proportion of households with 0, 1 or 2 nets and so on). In this way, the size of the net crop can be linked to distribution patterns among households while accounting for household size, making it possible to generate ownership distributions for each stratum of household size. The bivariate histogram of net crop to distribution of nets among households by household size made it possible to calculate the proportion of households with at least one ITN.

The number of malaria estimated cases per Plasmodium species was used to estimate deaths after applying a species-specific case fatality rates.\n\nMethod of estimation: The number of malaria deaths was estimated by one of two methods: i) For countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa: the number of deaths was estimated by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases by a fixed case fatality rate for each country, as described in the World malaria report 2008. This method was used for all countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa, where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems. A case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.40% was applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases, and a case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.06% was applied to the estimated number of P. vivax cases. For countries in the pre-elimination and elimination phases, and those with vital registration systems that reported more than 50% of all deaths (determined by comparing the number of reported deaths with those expected given a country\u2019s population size and crude deaths rate), the number of malaria deaths was derived from the number of reported deaths, adjusting for completeness of reporting. ii) For countries in Africa with a high proportion of deaths due to malaria: child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multicause model developed by the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Estimation Group which estimates causes of death for children aged 1\u201359 months. Mortality estimates were derived for eight causes of post-neonatal death (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, injuries, pertussis, tuberculosis and other disorders), causes arising in the neonatal period (prematurity, birth asphyxia and trauma, sepsis, and other conditions of the neonate) and other causes (e.g. malnutrition). Deaths due to measles, unknown causes and HIV/AIDS were estimated separately. The resulting cause-specific estimates were adjusted, country by country, to fit the estimated 1\u201359 month mortality envelopes (excluding HIV and measles deaths) for corresponding years. Estimated malaria parasite prevalence, was used as a covariate within the model. Deaths in those aged over 5 years were inferred from a relationship between levels of malaria mortality in different age groups and the intensity of malaria transmission; thus, the estimated malaria mortality rate in children aged under 5 years was used to infer malaria-specific mortality in older age groups.",

The population aged 5 to 9 years has relatively lower mortality in most countries as compared with young children and neonates. Nonetheless, this is an important age groups because the risksof deaths from injuries, notably road traffic injuries and drowning increase as young child age and become more mobile and therefore more independent.\n\nDefinition: The probability of a child aged 5 years in a specific year dying before reaching the age of 10 years, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period. The mortality rate for 5 to 9 year olds as defined here is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1000 live births.\n\nMethod of measurement: Most frequently used methods using the above-mentioned data sources are as follows: \u2022 Civil registration: Number of deaths at age 0 and population for the same age are used to calculate death rate which are then converted into age-specific probability of dying. \u2022 Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever born and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of infant mortality. \u2022 Surveys: A direct method is used based on birth history - a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. To reduce sampling errors, the estimates are generally presented as period rates, for five or 10 years preceding the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: The Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality of Estimation which includes representatives from UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division, produces trends of under-five mortality with standardized methodology by group of countries depending on the type and quality of source of data available. For countries with adequate trend of data from civil registration, the calculations of under-five and infant mortality rates are derived from a standard period abridged life table. For countries with survey data, under-five mortality rates are estimated using the Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model. See the Estimation methods link for details. These under-five mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to all Member States to the available data from Member States, that aim to ensure comparability of across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.

Reported data on malaria cases generally need to be adjusted for extent of health service use (treatment seeking), underreporting and lack of case confirmation (the likelihood that cases are parasite positive). WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of malaria and suspected cases tested with microscopy or RDT, submitted by national malaria control programmes. Underreporting is reported or estimated by countries. The extent of health service use (treatment seeking) data were obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health service use.\n\nMethod of estimation: Confirmed malaria cases for countries and areas outside Africa, and for low-transmission countries and areas in Africa are adjusted for extent of health service use (treatment seeking), underreporting and lack of case confirmation (the likelihood that cases are parasite positive). In high transmission areas in which the quality of surveillance data does not permit a robust estimate from the number of reported cases, but good data on parasite prevalence is available, the number of cases can be estimated from parasite prevalence.

This resolution led to the launch of the joint project on Medicine Prices and Availability by WHO and the international non-governmental organization Health Action International (HAI/WHO), as well as a proposed HAI/WHO methodology for collecting data and measuring components of access to medicines.\n\nDefinition: Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis.\nThe indicator is a multidimensional index reported as a proportion (%) of health facilities that have a defined core set of quality-assured medicines that are available and affordable relative to the total number of surveyed health facilities at national level.\n\nMethod of estimation: The index is computed as a ratio of the health facilities with available and affordable medicines for primary health care over the total number of the surveyed health facilities:\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3a3.\ud835\udc4f.3 =\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc5b)\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc5b)\nFor this indicator, the following variables are considered for a multidimensional understanding of the\ncomponents of access to medicines:\n\u2022 A core set of relevant essential medicines for primary healthcare\n\u2022 Regional burden of disease\n\u2022 Availability of a medicine\n\u2022 Price of a medicine\n\u2022 Treatment courses for each medicine (number of units per treatment & duration of\ntreatment)\n\u2022 National poverty line and lowest-paid unskilled government worker (LPGW) wage\n\u2022 Proxy for quality of the core set of relevant essential medicines.",

  "HEMOGLOBINLEVEL_PREGNANT_MEAN": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Mean haemoglobin concentration in women aged 15-49, by pregnancy status\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations.

  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_PRELPL_POP": "Definition: Proportion of the population pushed further below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures corresponds to the proportion of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. The relative poverty line corresponding to 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country. People living in household with total household consumption or income below the relative poverty line are considered poor. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed further below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures is computed as the ratio of the number of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. These poor people live in household with consumption or income levels already below the poverty line before health payments and are thus further impoverished when incurring health out-of-pocket payments. The poor are identified as those people living in households with total household consumption or income inclusive of any out-of-pocket health spending below a relative poverty corresponding to 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health is defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels.",

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_NONPREGNANT_PREV": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "M_Est_smk_curr": "Rationale: Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any smoked tobacco product, as estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \u201cCurrent\u201d means either daily or non-daily (occasional) use at the time of the survey. Smoked tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and any other form of smoked tobacco. Smoked tobacco products exclude smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco products and products that do not contain tobacco, such as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) of which e-cigarettes are a common type, as well as \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d. \"Crude-adjusted\" means the estimate was modelled as described below, and not age-standardized. Non-age-standardized estimates allow the calculation of the number of tobacco users in the country, but do not allow comparison with other countries, since different age structures in countries can affect comparability.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression was used to model prevalence of tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women, by age group and tobacco type. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries in the same UN subregion to fill information gaps. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a prevalence rate can be reported for each year even if the country did not run a survey every year. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys completed in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated.",

A household can also experience impoverishing health spending if its consumption before spending out of pocket was already below the poverty line; it is further impoverished after spending out of pocket.\nOut-of-pocket payments are defined according to the International Classification for Health Accounts as formal and informal payments made at the time of using any health care good or service provided by any type of provider; including user charges (co-payments) for covered services and direct payments for non-covered services; and excluding any pre-payment in the form of taxes, contributions or insurance premiums and any reimbursement by a third party such as the government, a health insurance fund or a private insurance company.\nThe poverty line is a country-specific relative poverty line (basic needs line) based on household spending to meet basic needs (food, housing and utilities). It is calculated as the average amount spent on food, housing (rent) and utilities (water, electricity and fuel used for cooking and heating) by households between the 25th and 35th percentiles of the household consumption distribution who report any spending on each item, respectively, adjusted for household size and composition using OECD equivalence scales.

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_REPRODUCTIVEAGE_PREV": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide.

The relative poverty line corresponding to 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country. People living in household with total household consumption or income below the relative poverty line are considered poor. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed further below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures is computed as the ratio of the number of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. These poor people live in household with consumption or income levels already below the poverty line before health payments and are thus further impoverished when incurring health out-of-pocket payments. The poor are identified as those people living in households with total household consumption or income inclusive of any out-of-pocket health spending below a relative poverty corresponding to 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health is defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels.

It also provides an indication of the success of reproductive health programmes in addressing demand for services.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15\u221249 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods.\nNumerator: Number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union who use modern contraceptive methods.\nDenominator: Total number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union in need of family planning\nWomen who are married is defined in relation to the marriage laws or customs of a country and women in a union refers to women living with their partner in the same household (also referred to as cohabiting unions, consensual unions, unmarried unions, or \u201cliving together\u201d.\nModern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intrauterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap, and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream, and sponge), the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM), emergency contraception, and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring).\n\nMethod of measurement: Household surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence use rate and demand for family planning.\nFor UHC, we use UNPD modelled estimates Those modelled data are available for married women, unmarried women and all women. This specific indicator refers to modelled data for married women only - for data comparability across countries and because data are available for all years.\nThe demand for family planning that is satisfied by using modern methods of contraception describes the number of women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) who are married or in a union who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method, as a proportion of the number of women of reproductive age who are married or in a union who have a demand for family planning.\n\nMethod of estimation: The United Nations Population Division produces a systematic and comprehensive series of annual estimates and projections of the percentage of demand for family planning that is satisfied among married or in-union women. A Bayesian hierarchical model combined with country-specific data is used to generate the estimates, projections and uncertainty assessments from survey data. The model accounts for differences by data source, sample population and contraceptive methods.\nSee more details:\nMethods for estimating and projecting key family planning indicators among all women of reproductive age https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/technical/index.asp",

  "M_Est_cig_curr_std": "Rationale: Adjusted and age-standardized prevalence rates are constructed solely for the purpose of comparing tobacco use prevalence estimates across multiple countries or across multiple time periods for the same country. These rates should not be used to estimate the number of smokers in the population.\n\nDefinition: Prevalence estimates for current smoking of cigarettes are age-standardized rates for adults aged 15 years and over, estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \u201cCurrent cigarette smoking\u201d includes both daily and non-daily or occasional cigarette smoking.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",
  "SDGFPALL": "Rationale: The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and who are currently using a modern method of contraception. The indicator is also referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods.\n\nMethod of measurement: The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning.\nContraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used.\nFor analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.\n\nMethod of estimation: There is no attempt to provide estimates for individual countries or areas when country or area data are not available.\nThe numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method.

It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it.

Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Children aged 6\u221259 months with a haemoglobin concentration less than 110 g/L, adjusted for altitude.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide.

  "SDGHPVRECEIVED": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12\u201323 months who received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine either any time before the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.\nWhen faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\",, by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted",

When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Number of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_PG_RELPL_STD": "Definition: The increase in poverty gap due to household health expenditures corresponds to the increase in the mean shortfall of consumption or income from a relative poverty line attributable to household health expenditures (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall). The increase in the mean shortfall is expressed as a percentage of the relative poverty line. The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union.\n\nMethod of estimation: Let\u2019s refer to household total consumption inclusive of household health spending as \u201cgross consumption\u201d and to household total consumption excluding household health spending as \u201cnet consumption\u201d. If income is used let\u2019s refer to \u201cnet income\u201d as household income less household expenditures on health and to \u201cgross income\u201d as household total income. Consumption is the preferred welfare measure and income should be only when consumption data is unavailable. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party like an insurer but exclude insurance premiums as Household expenditure on health correspond to out-of-pocket payments (OOPs - SHA 2011). Based on these concepts, the increase in the poverty gap due to household health expenditures is computed as the poverty gap based on \u201cnet consumption\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d less the poverty gap based on \u201cgross consumption\u201d or \u201cgross income\u201d. The poverty gap always corresponds to the mean shortfall in consumption (gross/net) or income (gross/net) from the poverty line (counting the nonpoor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. Differences in poverty gaps as defined here reflect then the increase in the mean shortfall in consumption or income due to household expenditures on health. The poverty gap always captures the depth of poverty as well as its incidence at the poverty line, hence difference in poverty gaps as defined here reflect both changes in the incidence of poverty due to household expenditures on health and changes in the depth of poverty due to health spending. The poverty line, is a relative one defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income. Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain the (increase) in the mean shortfall of consumption/income per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty gaps at national and regional levels. This indicator is not an official SDG indicator per se but links SDG goal 3.8 on Universal health coverage directly to the first SDG goal on poverty eradication. It is an important complement to SDG indicator 3.8.2. To fully understand progress towards UHC it needs to be monitored jointly with SDG indicator 3.8.1.",

The poor are identified as those people living in households with total household consumption or income inclusive of any out-of-pocket health spending below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day is converted to local currency units (LCUs) using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPIs). These poor people live in household with consumption or income levels already below the poverty line before health payments and are thus further impoverished when incurring health out-of-pocket payments. Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight.

  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_BNLFHU_TOT_HH": "Definition: The proportion of households with impoverishing health spending (households who are impoverished or further impoverished after out-of-pocket payments) measured using a relative poverty line reflecting basic needs (food, housing, utilities).\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of households with impoverishing health spending corresponds to the sum of the proportion of households impoverished after out-of-pocket payments and the proportion of households further impoverished after out-of-pocket payments.\nA household is considered to be impoverished if its per adult equivalent consumption is above the poverty line before spending out of pocket and below it after spending out of pocket. A household can also experience impoverishing health spending if its consumption before spending out of pocket was already below the poverty line; it is further impoverished after spending out of pocket.\nOut-of-pocket payments are defined according to the International Classification for Health Accounts as formal and informal payments made at the time of using any health care good or service provided by any type of provider; including user charges (co-payments) for covered services and direct payments for non-covered services; and excluding any pre-payment in the form of taxes, contributions or insurance premiums and any reimbursement by a third party such as the government, a health insurance fund or a private insurance company.\nThe poverty line is a country-specific relative poverty line (basic needs line) based on household spending to meet basic needs (food, housing and utilities). It is calculated as the average amount spent on food, housing (rent) and utilities (water, electricity and fuel used for cooking and heating) by households between the 25th and 35th percentiles of the household consumption distribution who report any spending on each item, respectively, adjusted for household size and composition using OECD equivalence scales. These households are selected based on the assumption that they are able to meet, but not necessarily exceed, basic needs for food, housing and utilities.\nFinancial protection is measured at the level of the health system rather than at the level of different types of health care, diseases or patient groups. To fully understand progress towards universal health coverage, indicators of financial protection should be monitored jointly with indicators of service coverage and access to health services (where available).",

Provisions not in place, or provisions put in place too recently to assess, were excluded from the request. An assessment of overall compliance with the law (all provisions considered together) was also requested.\nThe provisions of interest for assessing compliance with promotion and sponsorship laws are:\n1. A ban on free distribution of tobacco products in the mail or through other means\n2. A ban on promotional discounts on products\n3. A ban on non-tobacco goods and services\u00a0 being identified with tobacco brand names\n4. A ban on use of brand names of non-tobacco goods and services for tobacco products\n5. A ban on the appearance of tobacco brands or products in TV and/or films\n6.

  "HEMOGLOBINLEVEL_REPRODUCTIVEAGE_MEAN": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Mean haemoglobin concentration in women aged 15-49, by pregnancy status\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_P190_POP": "Definition: Proportion of the population pushed further below an absolute poverty line by household health expenditures corresponds to the proportion of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. The international poverty line of 1.90 a day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) is used (shown as $1.90 a day) to demonstrate the interdependency between SDG target 1.1 the eradication of extreme poverty and SDG target 3.8 (universal coverage).\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed further below an international poverty line by household health expenditures (who are further impoverished by out-of-pocket health expenditures) is computed as the ratio of the number of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. The poor are identified as those people living in households with total household consumption or income inclusive of any out-of-pocket health spending below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day is converted to local currency units (LCUs) using 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and consumer price indices (CPIs). These poor people live in household with consumption or income levels already below the poverty line before health payments and are thus further impoverished when incurring health out-of-pocket payments. Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage (UHC) per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The 1.90 a day poverty line in 2011 PPP updates the 1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 PPP and is often referred to as the \u201cextreme poverty line\u201d which underlies SDG target 1.1. With this poverty line the proportion of the population pushed further into extreme poverty by out-of-pocket payments are close to or equal to zero in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels.

  "MALARIA_EST_MORTALITY": "Definition: Estimated number of malaria deaths per 100 000 population at risk\n\nMethod of measurement: The number of deaths due to indigenously acquired malaria was reported by national malaria control programs to WHO. The number of malaria estimated cases per Plasmodium species was used to estimate deaths after applying a species-specific case fatality rates.\n\nMethod of estimation: The number of malaria deaths was estimated by one of two methods: i) For countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa: the number of deaths was estimated by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases by a fixed case fatality rate for each country, as described in the World malaria report 2008. This method was used for all countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa, where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems. A case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.40% was applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases, and a case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.06% was applied to the estimated number of P. vivax cases. For countries in the pre-elimination and elimination phases, and those with vital registration systems that reported more than 50% of all deaths (determined by comparing the number of reported deaths with those expected given a country\u2019s population size and crude deaths rate), the number of malaria deaths was derived from the number of reported deaths, adjusting for completeness of reporting. ii) For countries in Africa with a high proportion of deaths due to malaria: child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multi-cause model developed by the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Estimation Group which estimates causes of death for children aged 1\u201359 months. Mortality estimates were derived for eight causes of post-neonatal death (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, injuries, pertussis, tuberculosis and other disorders), causes arising in the neonatal period (prematurity, birth asphyxia and trauma, sepsis, and other conditions of the neonate) and other causes (e.g. malnutrition). Deaths due to measles, unknown causes and HIV/AIDS were estimated separately. The resulting cause-specific estimates were adjusted, country by country, to fit the estimated 1\u201359 month mortality envelopes (excluding HIV and measles deaths) for corresponding years. Estimated malaria parasite prevalence, was used as a covariate within the model. Deaths in those aged over 5 years were inferred from a relationship between levels of malaria mortality in different age groups and the intensity of malaria transmission; thus, the estimated malaria mortality rate in children aged under 5 years was used to infer malaria-specific mortality in older age groups.\nThe denominator is estimated, using official UN population and population at risk estimates for countries with sub-national endemicity.",
  "Yth_curr_tob_use": "Rationale: Crude prevalence rates can be used to assess the actual use of tobacco in a country and to generate an estimate of the number of tobacco users in the population.\n\nDefinition: The crude rate, expressed as a percentage of the total population, refers to the number of current users of any tobacco product per 100 population of the country. When this crude prevalence rate is multiplied by the country\u2019s population, the result is the number of current users of any tobacco product in the country. The definition of \"current\" varies between surveys, but often means use of any tobacco product at least once during a defined period leading up to the survey date. Tobacco use includes use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, waterpipes, heated tobacco products, any form of smokeless tobacco (chewed, sucked, nasal) and any other form of tobacco.

Child growth is the most widely used indicator of nutritional status in a community and is internationally recognized as an important public-health indicator for monitoring health in populations. In addition, children who suffer from growth retardation as a result of poor diets and/or recurrent infections tend to have a greater risk of suffering illness and death.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of severe wasting (defined as more than three standard deviations below the median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under five years of age.

  "CHILDMORT_MORTALITY_10TO14": "Rationale: 10 to 14 year mortality rate measures changes in older child survival. The population aged 10 to 14 years has relatively lower mortality in most countries as compared with young children and neonates. Nonetheless, this is an important age groups because the risksof deaths from injuries, notably road traffic injuries and drowning increase as young child age and become more mobile and therefore more independent.\n\nDefinition: The probability of a child aged 10 years in a specific year dying before reaching the age of 15 years, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period. The mortality rate for 10 to 14 year olds as defined here is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1000 live births.\n\nMethod of measurement: Most frequently used methods using the above-mentioned data sources are as follows: \u2022 Civil registration: Number of deaths at age 0 and population for the same age are used to calculate death rate which are then converted into age-specific probability of dying. \u2022 Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever born and how many are still alive. The Brass method and model life tables are then used to obtain an estimate of infant mortality. \u2022 Surveys: A direct method is used based on birth history - a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime. To reduce sampling errors, the estimates are generally presented as period rates, for five or 10 years preceding the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: The Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality of Estimation which includes representatives from UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division, produces trends of under-five mortality with standardized methodology by group of countries depending on the type and quality of source of data available. For countries with adequate trend of data from civil registration, the calculations of under-five and infant mortality rates are derived from a standard period abridged life table. For countries with survey data, under-five mortality rates are estimated using the Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model. See the Estimation methods link for details. These under-five mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to all Member States to the available data from Member States, that aim to ensure comparability of across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.

The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed below a poverty line by household health expenditures (impoverished by health expenditures) is computed as the difference in the incidence of poverty based on household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income gross and net of health expenditures. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishment due to spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global. regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels.

  "M_Est_tob_curr_std": "Rationale: Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis. Tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and all forms of smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco. Tobacco products exclude e-cigarettes (which do not contain tobacco), \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",
  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_NONPREGNANT_NUM": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Number of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide.

People living in household with total household consumption or income below the relative poverty line are considered poor. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed further below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures is computed as the ratio of the number of poor people spending any amount on health out-of-pocket in the total population. These poor people live in household with consumption or income levels already below the poverty line before health payments and are thus further impoverished when incurring health out-of-pocket payments. The poor are identified as those people living in households with total household consumption or income inclusive of any out-of-pocket health spending below a relative poverty corresponding to 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita.

Capacity to pay for health care is defined as total household consumption minus a standard amount to cover basic needs (food, housing and utilities).\n\nMethod of estimation: Catastrophic health spending occurs when the amount a household pays out of pocket exceeds a predefined share of its capacity to pay for health care. This may mean the household can no longer afford to meet other basic needs (for example, food, housing, water, electricity and fuel for cooking and heating) or cannot afford to meet basic needs without drawing on savings, selling assets or borrowing. Capacity to pay for health care can be defined in different ways (see information under Denominator).\nNumerator: Out-of-pocket payments, defined according to the International Classification for Health Accounts as formal and informal payments made at the time of using any health care good or service provided by any type of provider; including user charges (co-payments) for covered services and direct payments for non-covered services; and excluding any pre-payment in the form of taxes, contributions or insurance premiums and any reimbursement by a third party such as the government, a health insurance fund or a private insurance company.\nDenominator: Using this metric, a household\u2019s capacity to pay for health care is defined as per adult equivalent total household consumption minus a standard amount to cover basic needs. The standard amount is calculated as the average amount spent on food, housing (rent) and utilities (water, electricity and fuel used for cooking and heating) by households between the 25th and 35th percentiles of the household consumption distribution who report any spending on each item, respectively, adjusted for household size and composition using OECD equivalence scales. These households are selected based on the assumption that they are able to meet, but not necessarily exceed, basic needs for food, housing and utilities. This standard amount is also used as a poverty line (basic needs line) to measure impoverishing health spending.\nDisaggregation: Results are disaggregated into household quintiles by consumption per person using OECD equivalence scales. Disaggregation by place of residence (urban\u2013rural), age or employment status of the head of the household, household composition and other factors is included in country-level and regional-level analysis where relevant.\nFinancial protection is measured at the level of the health system rather than at the level of different types of health care, diseases or patient groups.

  "HEMOGLOBINLEVEL_NONPREGNANT_MEAN": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Mean haemoglobin concentration in women aged 15-49, by pregnancy status\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

The estimate is based on the reconstructed cohort method. Persistence to last grade of primary is the percentage of children enrolled in the first grade of primary school who eventually reach the last grade of primary education. The estimate is based on the reconstructed cohort method.\n\nMethod of measurement: Cohort survival rate is calculated by dividing the total number of children belonging to a cohort who reached each successive grade of the specified level of education by the number of children in the same cohort; those originally enrolled in the first grade of primary education, and multiplying by 100. To reflect current patterns of grade transition, it is calculated based on the reconstructed cohort method, which uses data on enrollment by grade for the two most recent years and data on repeaters by grade for the most recent of those two years. Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented.

There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any smoked tobacco product, as estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \u201cCurrent\u201d means either daily or non-daily (occasional) use at the time of the survey. Smoked tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and any other form of smoked tobacco. Smoked tobacco products exclude smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco products and products that do not contain tobacco, such as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) of which e-cigarettes are a common type, as well as \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d. Age-standardization is a method to adjust a country's prevalence rate using the WHO standard population (applied to age-specific prevalence rates) which allows meaningful comparison of rates between countries.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco smoking for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population.\nEstimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",
