  "AIR_10": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution was assessed. Ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks which are complex mixtures of air  pollutants, many of which are harmful to health. Of all of these  pollutants, fine particulate matter has the greatest effect on human  health.\nIn high-income countries, urban outdoor air pollution ranks in the top ten risk factors to health, and is the first environmental risk factors.\n\nDefinition: The burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution can be expressed as :\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of deaths\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Death rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DALYs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Number of years life lost (YLLs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YLLs rate (both crude and age-standardized)\nDeath (DALYs, or YLLs) rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population (or indicated if a different population group is used, e.g. children under 5 years). Age-standardized rates adjust for differences in population age distributionby applying the observed age-specific mortality (or other health outcomes) rates for each population to a standard population. The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The age-standardized rates can therefore be used to compare the rates of countries without being affected by the differences in age distribution from country to country.\nEvidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to ambient air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Acute respiratory infectionsin young children (estimated under 5 years of age);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Lung\u00a0 cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n\nMethod of estimation: Burden of disease is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed).\nThis allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter.\nApplying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from ambient air pollution.",

The full birth histories were used to estimate the probability of dying in children aged 5 to 14 (10q5) for three reference periods prior to each survey (0-3 years prior to the survey, 4-7 years, and 8-11 years). Summary birth histories collected in censuses and surveys were not included, because indirect demographic methods used to convert such data into mortality indices were originally designed to estimate mortality in children below age 5, and there has been little assessment of the performance of these indirect approaches when applied to older children\n\nMethod of estimation: The statistical model developed for under-five mortality (Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model \u2013 or B3 model) was used to obtain a smooth trend curve averaging over the estimates and accounting for potential outliers and biases in data series.

The live births were calculated by taking the infant population from the World Population Prospects: the 2012 revision (15) and adding back the deaths in the neonatal and post-neonatal periods while accounting for the fraction of period lived before the death.

These amounts are then averaged across all households (including those without any health expenditure) to get the overall average change in the poverty gap due to health spending.

Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (promotive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long term care) provided by any type of provider.

  "HIV_0000000025": "Rationale: In order to protect themselves and to prevent infecting others, it is important for individuals to know their HIV status. Knowledge of one\u2019s status is also a critical factor in the decision to seek treatment. Testing volume is useful for programme monitoring, commodity forecasting, staff resource planning and as an input into the UNAIDS model to monitor progress towards the first 90 (90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status), if required.\n\nDefinition: \u25cf\t0\u201314 years for children and 15 years and older by sex (men and women) for adults.\n\nMethod of estimation: Numerator: The reported number should be collected from HTS programme registers, log books and reporting forms. Reported data should be a count of the number of tests conducted where results were returned to a person and not the number of unique persons who tested at least once during the calendar year. Please note that only tests conducted where the results are returned to the person should be counted. Also, a person should only be counted as testing once, even if up to three different assays are performed to confirm an HIV-positive diagnosis according to the national testing algorithm.

  "HIV_0000000026": "Rationale: The number of new infections is important for monitoring both epidemic trends and dynamics within the population.\n\nDefinition: The estimated annual number new HIV infections estimated by the end of a specific year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Analysis of country data on HIV prevalence, particularly among young age groups and, where available, direct HIV incidence data; internationally consistent modelled estimates, e.g. Spectrum AIM.\n\nMethod of estimation: Modelled estimates of the number of new HIV infections are produced and compiled \u00a0by country teams and published annually by UNAIDS and WHO. Standard methods and tools for HIV estimates that are appropriate to the pattern of the HIV epidemic are used . However, to obtain the best possible estimates, judgment needs to be used as to the quality of the data and how representative it is of the population.",
  "HIV_ARTCOVERAGE": "Rationale: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to reduce mortality among those infected and efforts are being made to make it more affordable within low- and middle-income countries. This indicator assesses the progress in providing antiretroviral combination therapy to all people with\u00a0 HIV infection. As the HIV epidemic matures, increasing numbers of people are reaching advanced stages of HIV infection. Over recent years WHO has issued various updates in the ARV guidelines. Under the 2013 WHO consolidated guidelines, roughly 85% people living with HIV would be eligible for treatment in 2013. For reasons of comparibility across countries and over time in the context of changing recommendations, this indicator relates to the number of people receiving ART as of proportion of the overall estimated number of people living with HIV.\u00a0 The ranges around the levels of people living with HIV who received ART are based on the uncertainty bounds around the estimates of people living with HIV.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of adults and children with HIV infection currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocols (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) among the estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\nNumerator: Number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period.\nDenominator: Estimated number of adults and children with HIV infection.\n\nMethod of measurement: Numerator:\u00a0The number of adults and children with HIV infection who are currently receiving antiretroviral combination therapy can be obtained through data collected from facility-based antiretroviral therapy registers or drug supply management systems. These are then tallied and transferred to cross-sectional monthly or quarterly reports which can then be aggregated for national totals. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in the private sector and public sector should be included in the numerator where data are available. Antiretroviral therapy taken only for the purpose of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis are not included in this indicator. HIV-infected pregnant women who are eligible for antiretroviral therapy and on antiretroviral therapy for their own treatment are included in this indicator.\nDenominator: The denominator is generated by estimating the number of people with\u00a0 HIV infection. A standard modelling method is recommended. The Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)* and Spectrum*, softwares have been developed by the UNAIDS/WHO Reference Group on Estimates, Models and Projections.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF are responsible for reporting data for this indicator at the international level, and have been compiling country specific data since 2003.Predominant type of statistics: predicted\n\nNumerator: The data on people receiving antiretroviral therapy are collected through a joint joint international monitoring and reporting process\u00a0 with WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat.\u00a0 For this purpose a joint data tool has been developed that contains Global AIDS Progress Reporting (GARPR) indicators -- before 2012 known as UNGASS indicators -- as well as as well additional WHO/UNICEF Universal Access Health Sector indicators. Data are also compiled from the most recent reports received by WHO and/or UNAIDS from health ministries or from other reliable sources in the countries, such as bilateral partners, foundations and nongovernmental organizations that are major providers of treatment services.\u00a0In order to facilitate collaboration at country level, the country offices of WHO, UNICEF and the UNAIDS Secretariat, work jointly with national counterparts and partner agencies to collate and validate data in a single collaborative consultation process.\nIn addition, at least twice a year, international data reconciliation meetings are organized to review and validate data reported to WHO, UNICEF, the UNAIDS Secretariat, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and the United States President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Where discrepancies are identified between data reported to the different organizations, follow-up letters are sent to UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO country offices in order to liaise with national authorities to seek clarification and resolve discrepancies.\nThe estimates of antiretroviral therapy coverage presented here are calculated by dividing the estimated number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy as of December by the number of people estimated to need treatment in same year (based on UNAIDS/WHO methods).",

  "MALARIA002": "Definition: -\n\nMethod of estimation: The number of malaria cases was estimated by one of two methods:\u00a0\ni) For countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa: estimates of the number of cases were made by adjusting the number of reported malaria cases for completeness of reporting, the likelihood that cases are parasite positive and the extent of health-service use. The procedure, which is described in the World malaria report 2008 (4,5), combines data reported by national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) (reported cases, reporting completeness, likelihood that cases are parasite positive) with those obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health-service use. Projections to 2015 were made using the results of country-specific segmented regression analyses (6). The trend line from the most recent segment of years was extrapolated to project cases and deaths for 2014 and 2015. The number of P. vivax malaria cases in each country was estimated by multiplying the country\u2019s reported proportion of cases that are P. vivax by the total number of estimated cases for the country.\u00a0\n\u00a0ii)\u00a0 For high-transmission countries in Africa: for some African countries, the quality of surveillance data did not permit a convincing estimate to be made from the number of reported cases. Hence, estimates of the number of malaria cases were derived from information\u00a0 on parasite prevalence obtained from household surveys. First, parasite prevalence data from 27 573 georeferenced population clusters between 1995 and 2014 were assembled within a spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical model, along with environmental and sociodemographic covariates and data on use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and access to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The geospatial model enabled predictions to be made of P. falciparum parasite prevalence in children aged 2\u201310 years at a resolution of 5 \u00d7 5 km2 across all endemic African countries for each year from 2000 to 2015. Second, an ensemble model was developed to predict malaria incidence as a function of parasite prevalence. The model was then applied to the estimated parasite prevalence, to obtain estimates of the malaria case incidence at 5 \u00d7 5 km2\u00a0 resolution for each year from 2000 to 2015. Data for each 5 \u00d7 5 km2 area were then aggregated within country and regional boundaries to obtain national estimates and regional estimates of malaria cases (7 ).",
  "MALARIA003": "Definition: -\n\nMethod of estimation: The number of malaria deaths was estimated by one of two methods:\n\ni) For countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa: the number of deaths was estimated by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases by a fixed case fatality rate for each country, as described in the World malaria report 2008. \nThis method was used for all countries outside Africa and for low-transmission countries in Africa, where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems. A case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.40% was applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases, and a case fatality rate of between 0.01% and 0.06% was applied to the estimated number of P. vivax cases. \nFor countries in the pre-elimination and elimination phases, and those with vital registration systems that reported more than 50% of all deaths (determined by comparing the number of reported deaths with those expected given a country\u2019s population size and crude deaths rate), the number of malaria deaths was derived from the number of reported deaths, adjusting for completeness of reporting.\n\nii) For countries in Africa with a high proportion of deaths due to malaria: child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multicause model developed by the Maternal and Child Health Epidemiology Estimation Group which estimates causes of death for children aged 1\u201359 months. \nMortality estimates were derived for seven causes of post-neonatal death (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, injuries, pertussis and other disorders), causes arising in the neonatal period (prematurity, birth asphyxia and trauma, sepsis, and other conditions of the neonate) and other causes (e.g. malnutrition). Deaths due to measles, unknown causes and HIV/AIDS were estimated separately. \nThe resulting cause-specific estimates were adjusted, country by country, to fit the estimated 1\u201359 month mortality envelopes (excluding HIV and measles deaths) for corresponding years. \nEstimated malaria parasite prevalence, as described above, was used as a covariate within the model. \nDeaths in those aged over 5 years were inferred from a relationship between levels of malaria mortality in different age groups and the intensity of malaria transmission; thus, the estimated malaria mortality rate in children aged under 5 years was used to infer malaria-specific mortality in older age groups.",
  "MCV2": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of children who have received two doses of measles containing vaccine (MCV2) in a given year, according to the nationally recommended schedule.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.   \n\t\n\n\n\tHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as percentage of children who received the 2nd dose of measles containing vaccine according to the nationally recommended schedule.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\n\n\tThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics: \n\t\n\tCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated. \n\n\tConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.   When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.   \n\n\n\tRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.   \n\n\n\tNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.   \n\n\n\tLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.   \n\n\n\tDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.   \n\n\tPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",
  "MDG_0000000001": "Rationale: Infant mortality represents an important component of under-five mortality. Like under-five mortality, infant mortality rates measure child survival. They also reflect the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care. Since data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases (morbidity data) frequently are unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. Infant mortality rate is an MDG indicator.\n\nDefinition: Infant mortality rate is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of one, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.\r\n\r\nInfant mortality rate is strictly speaking not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time) but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as rate per 1000 live births.\n\nMethod of measurement: Most frequently used methods using the above-mentioned data sources are as follows:\r\n\u2022\u00a0Civil registration: Number of deaths at age 0 and population for the same age are used to calculate death rate which are then converted into age-specific probability of dying. \r\n\u2022\u00a0Census and surveys: An indirect method is used based on questions to each woman of reproductive age as to how many children she has ever born and how many are still alive.

To reduce sampling errors, the estimates are generally presented as period rates, for five or 10 years preceding the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: The Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality of Estimation (UN\u00a0IGME) which includes representatives from UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank and the United Nations Population Division,\u00a0produces trends of infant mortality rates with standardized methodology by group of countries depending on the type and quality of source of data available.\u00a0\r\nFor countries with adequate trend of data from civil registration, the calculations of\u00a0under-five\u00a0and infant mortality rates are\u00a0derived from a standard period abridged life table.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor countries with survey data, since infant mortality rates from birth histories of surveys are exposed to recall biases, infant mortality is derived from the projection of under-five mortality rates converted into infant mortality rates using the Bayesian B-splines bias-adjusted model.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThese infant mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to all Member States to the available data from Member States, that aim to ensure comparability of across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted and predicted.",
  "MDG_0000000003": "Rationale: Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential for improving\n\tsexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socioeconomic improvement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.\n\nDefinition: The annual number of births to women aged 15-19 years per 1,000 women in that age group. It is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.\n\nMethod of measurement: The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. In the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.\n\t\n\tIn the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth\n\thistories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a\n\treference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15\n\tand 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation\n\tyear corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective\n\tbirth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number\n\tof births in the 12 months preceding the survey.\n\n\tWith census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the\n\tnumber of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator\n\tand the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for underregistration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the\n\town-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number\n\tof years before the census.\n\n\tFor a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of\n\tFertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11,\n\t(http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf).

(http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/Manual_X/Manual_X.htm).\n\nMethod of estimation: For civil registration data, data on births or the adolescent birth rate are obtained from country-reported data from the United Nations Statistics Division or regional Statistics Divisions or statistical units (ESCWA, ESCAP, CARICOM, SPC). The population figures are obtained from the last revision of the United Nations Population Division World Population Prospects and only exceptionally from other sources. Survey data are obtained from national household surveys that are internationally coordinated\u2014such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)\u2014and other nationally-sponsored surveys. Other national surveys conducted as part of the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) or the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) may be considered as well. The data are taken from published survey reports or, in exceptional cases, other published analytical reports. Whenever the estimates are available in the survey report, they are directly taken from it. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which occasionally may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response.

  "MDG_0000000026": "Rationale: In 2015, in anticipation of the launch of the SDGs, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners released a consensus statement and full strategy paper on ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM).The EPMM target for reducing the global maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by 2030 was adopted as SDG target 3.1: reduce global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 live births by 2030.  \r\nWHO leads the UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group (MMEIG) composed of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division, and the World Bank Group. The MMEIG is tasked with generating internationally comparable estimates of maternal mortality for the purposes of global monitoring, having done so for Millennium Development Goal reporting and will continue to do under the Sustainable Development Goals framework.\r\nMonitoring maternal health is widely seen as one of the most complicated health indicators within global frameworks. Significant unfinished business and challenges remain with estimating MMR; primarily due to the availability and usability of population based data on maternal death.\n\nDefinition: The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth.\r\nMaternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.\r\nLive birth : The complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nInternational reporting of maternal mortality\r\nFor the purpose of international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates. \r\n\r\nThe recording of later deaths is encouraged to inform national, regional, and global understanding of these events\n\nMethod of measurement: The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\r\n\r\nMaternal mortality ratio = (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) X 100,000\r\n\r\nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. However, there are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take into account these data quality issues. Adjustments for underreporting and misclassification of deaths and model-based estimates should be made in the cases where data are not reliable.\r\n\r\nBecause maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or overtime comparisons.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and MICS (round 4 and 5) surveys measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth, or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.\r\n\r\nReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these are maternal or pregnancy-related.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, UNPD, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. Data available from countries varies in terms of the source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. The current methodology employed by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) in this round followed an improved approach that built directly upon methods used to produce the 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015 maternal mortality estimates. Estimates for this round were generated using a Bayesian approach, referred to as the Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, or BMat model.  This enhanced methodology uses the same core estimation method as in those previous rounds, but adds refinements to optimize the use of country-specific data sources and excludes late maternal deaths.  It therefore provides more accurate estimates, and a more realistic assessment of certainty about those estimates. The new model still incorporates the same covariates which are; the Gross Domestic Product per capita based on purchasing power parity conversion (GDP), the general fertility rate (GFR), and proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker (SAB). The MMEIG has developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for underreporting and, where necessary, adjustment for incompleteness and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.

Those with severe or advanced clinical disease (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) should start antiretroviral therapy irrespective of CD4 cell count. \n\nIn order to compare the impact of the new guildelines, both sets of needs for the year 2009 are included, i.e. estimated needs estimated based on a threshold for initiation of antiretroviral therapy with < 200 cells/mm3 (old guidelines) as well as < 350 cells/mm3 (new guidelines).\n\u00a0\nEstimating antiretroviral therapy coverage\nThe estimates of antiretroviral therapy coverage presented here are calculated by dividing the estimated number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy as of December by the number of people estimated to need treatment in same year (based on UNAIDS/WHO methods). \n\nPredominant type of statistics: predicted",

Two populations with the same age-specific mortality rates for a particular cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their populations are different.

  "MORT_MATERNALNUM": "Definition: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy.\n\nMethod of measurement: Recorded or estimated number of maternal deaths. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, UNPD, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. Data available from countries varies in terms of the source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. The current methodology employed by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) in this round followed an improved approach that built directly upon methods used to produce the 2008, 2010,  2013 and 2015 maternal mortality estimates. Estimates for this round were generated using a Bayesian approach, referred to as the Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, or BMat model. This enhanced methodology uses the same core estimation method as in those previous rounds, but adds refinements to optimize the use of country-specific data sources and excludes late maternal deaths.  It therefore provides more accurate estimates, and a more realistic assessment of certainty about those estimates. The new model still incorporates the same covariates which are; the Gross Domestic Product per capita based on purchasing power parity conversion (GDP), the general fertility rate (GFR), and proportion of births attended by a skilled health worker (SAB)). The MMEIG  has developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for underreporting and, where necessary, adjustment for incompleteness and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.

  "NCD_GLUC_01": "Rationale: The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).  When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia are recommended. If fasting blood glucose is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, diabetes is diagnosed. \nAn individual with low fasting blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) \u2013 below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) \u2013 will experience dizziness, sweating, palpitations, blurred vision and other symptoms that have to be monitored. \nIncreased fasting blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) is an indicator of a higher risk to diabetes. \nAn individual\u2019s fasting blood plasma glucose (FPG) may be in the normal range because the individual is not diabetic or because of effective treatment with glucose-lowering medication in diabetics.  \nMean FPG at the national level is used as a proxy for both promotion of healthy diets and behaviours and, treatment of diabetes.\n\nDefinition: Mean fasting blood glucose of defined population in mmol/l. In adults 18 years and older and standardized by age. Yearly national estimates.\n\nMethod of measurement: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels are determined by taking a blood sample from participants who have fasted for at least 8 hours. It can be measured in mmol/L or in mg/dL. For comparability, these values are converted in mmol/L. Other related biomarkers, such as haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), can be used to help calculate national estimates.\n\nMethod of estimation: For producing comparable national estimates, data observations based on mean FPG, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c or combinations of these are all converted to mean FPG. A Bayesian hierarchical model is then fitted to these data to calculate age-sex-year-country specific prevalences, which accounts for national versus subnational data sources and urban versus rural data sources, and allows for variation in prevalence across age and sex. Age-standardized estimates are then produced by applying the crude estimates to the WHO Standard Population.Methodological details can be found here: https://www.who.int/diabetes/global-report/en/.

When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia are recommended. If fasting blood glucose is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, diabetes is diagnosed. \nAn individual with low fasting blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) \u2013 below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) \u2013 will experience dizziness, sweating, palpitations, blurred vision and other symptoms that have to be monitored. \nIncreased fasting blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) is an indicator of a higher risk to diabetes. \nAn individual\u2019s fasting blood plasma glucose (FPG) may be in the normal range because the individual is not diabetic or because of effective treatment with glucose-lowering medication in diabetics.  \nMean FPG at the national level is used as a proxy for both promotion of healthy diets and behaviours and, treatment of diabetes.\n\nDefinition: Mean fasting blood glucose of defined population in mmol/l. In adults 18 years and older and standardized by age. Yearly national estimates.\n\nMethod of measurement: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels are determined by taking a blood sample from participants who have fasted for at least 8 hours. It can be measured in mmol/L or in mg/dL. For comparability, these values are converted in mmol/L. Other related biomarkers, such as haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), can be used to help calculate national estimates.\n\nMethod of estimation: For producing comparable national estimates, data observations based on mean FPG, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c or combinations of these are all converted to mean FPG. A Bayesian hierarchical model is then fitted to these data to calculate age-sex-year-country specific prevalences, which accounts for national versus subnational data sources and urban versus rural data sources, and allows for variation in prevalence across age and sex. Age-standardized estimates are then produced by applying the crude estimates to the WHO Standard Population.Methodological details can be found here: https://www.who.int/diabetes/global-report/en/.

  "NUTRITION_570": "Rationale: Early initiation of breastfeeding, within one hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infection and reduces newborn mortality. It facilitates emotional bonding of the mother and the baby and has a positive impact on duration of exclusive breastfeeding. When a mother initiates breastfeeding within one hour after birth, production of breast milk is stimulated. The yellow or golden first milk produced in the first days, also called colostrum, is an important source of nutrition and immune protection for the newborn.\n\nDefinition: Proportion of children born in the last 24 months who were put to the breast within one hour of birth\n\nMethod of measurement: Female survey respondents are asked about their youngest living child aged less than 24 months who is currently living with the respondent. The numerator and denominator include living and deceased children who were born within the past 24 months.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data compiled from household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).",
  "NUTRITION_579": "Rationale: This indicator belongs to a set of indicators whose purpose is to measure infant and young child feeding practices, policies and programmes.

Exclusive breastfeeding is the single most effective intervention to improve the survival of children. Improving infant and young child feeding practices is therefore critical to improved nutrition, health and development of children.\n\nDefinition: Proportion of infants 0\u20135 months of age (0 to < 6 months) who are fed exclusively with breast milk.\n\nMethod of measurement: Percentage of infants 0\u20135 months of age who are fed exclusively with breast milk = (Infants 0\u20135 months of age who received only breast milk during the previous day/Infants 0\u20135 months of age) x 100\u00a0.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) include questions on liquids and foods given the previous day, and number of milk feeds the previous day, to learn if the child is being exclusively breastfed.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO and UNICEF jointly collect data on infant and young child feeding, pooling information from national surveys. The WHO Programme of Nutrition, Physical Activity adn Obesity, at the Regional Office for Europe compiles country information on exclusive breastfeeding independently. Note, many developed country data refer to exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, which provides lower estimates than the standard measure of exclusive breastfeeding averaged over the first six months. The two sources have been combined to display all available data on exclusive breastfeeding.",

This form of malnutrition results from expending too few calories for the amount of food consumed and increases the risk of noncommunicable diseases later in life. Child overweight is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators. Child growth is the most widely used indicator of nutritional status in a community and is internationally recognized as an important public-health indicator for monitoring health in populations.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of overweight (defined as more than two standard deviations above the median weight-for-height of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under five years of age.

There are eight indoor public places for this indicator, so the maximum count is 8.\u00a0 A \"complete\" smoking ban is defined such that smoking is not allowed at any time in any indoor area under any circumstance, including private functions and separate smoking rooms. Under the definition of complete smoking ban, health care facilities may exempt enclosed rooms in psychiatric facilities and long term facilities, such as nursing homes for patients or residents' use, and government facilities may exempt designated smoking rooms in prison facilities or other similar institutions. The 8 categories are: \n\u2022 health-care facilities;\n\u2022 educational facilities other than universities;\n\u2022 universities;\n\u2022 government facilities;\n\u2022 indoor offices;\n\u2022 restaurants;\n\u2022 pubs and bars;\n\u2022 public transport.\n\nMethod of estimation: <p>Country reported data.</p>",
  "P_Group": "Rationale: In 2008, WHO introduced the MPOWER package to assist in the country-level implementation of six effective measures to reduce demand for tobacco products.\u00a0 Each measure reflects at least one provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\u00a0 The letter P in MPOWER denotes the \"Protect from tobacco smoke\" measure. Second-hand tobacco smoke is present in virtually all public places where smoking is permitted, and there is no safe level of exposure. Breathing secondhand tobacco smoke has serious and often fatal health consequences. Globally, it is estimated that about one third of adults are regularly exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke. 100% smoke-free environments are the only proven way to adequately protect the health of people from the harmful effects of secondhand tobacco smoke. This indicator measures the implementation status of the P measure.\n\nDefinition: Country's legislation is assessed to determine whether smoke-free laws exist in each of the following places at either the national or subnational level:\n\u2022 health-care facilities;\n\u2022 educational facilities other than universities;\n\u2022 universities;\n\u2022 government facilities;\n\u2022 indoor offices;\n\u2022 restaurants;\n\u2022 pubs and bars;\n\u2022 public transport.\nThe implementation status of the Smoke-free environments measure was classified by grouping countries into five groups.\nThe groupings for this indicator are:\n1 = Data not reported/not categorized*\n2 = Up to two public places completely smoke-free\n3 = Three to five public places completely smoke-free\n4 = Six to seven public places completely smoke-free\n6 = All public places completely smoke-free (or at least 90% of the population covered by complete subnational smoke-free legislation)\n*In several countries, in order to significantly expand the creation of smoke-free places, including restaurants and bars, it was politically necessary to include exceptions to the law that allowed for the provision of designated smoking rooms. The requirements for designated smoking rooms are so technically complex and stringent that, for practical purposes, few or no establishments are expected to implement them. Because no data were requested on the number of complex designated smoking rooms actually constructed, it is not possible to know whether these laws have resulted in the complete absence of such rooms, as intended.

  "PCV3": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds  who have received three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV3) in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.  Household surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated percentage of surviving infants who received the 3rd dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In countries where the national schedule recommends two doses during infancy and a booster dose at 12 months or later based on the epidemiology of disease in the country, coverage estimates may reflect the percentage of surviving infants who received two doses of PCV prior to the 1st birthday.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\n\n\tThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics: \n\t\n\tCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated. \n\n\tConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.   When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.   \n\n\n\tRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.   \n\n\n\tNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.   \n\n\n\tLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.   \n\n\n\tDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.   \n\n\tPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",
  "PercposANC": "Rationale: Syphilis infection in antenatal care attendees is a marker of syphilis prevalence in the community, and thus a measure of the effectiveness of STI-prevention programmes. This indicator is useful in measuring overall burden of disease and may provide early warning of potential changes in HIV transmission in the general population.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of antenatal care attendees who tested positive for syphilis.\nNumerator: Number of antenatal care attendees with a positive syphilis serology.\nDenominator: Number of antenatal care attendees who received syphilis serology testing.\n\nMethod of measurement: Syphilis positivity can be measured using either non-treponemal tests (e.g., RPR or VDRL), treponemal tests (e.g. TPHA, TPPA, EIA, or a variety of available rapid tests), or ideally a combination of both. A reactive non-treponemal test, particularly if the titre is > 1:8, is suggestive of active infection, whereas positivity with a treponemal test indicates any previous infection even if treated successfully. For the purposes of this indicator (intended to measure seropositivity), it is acceptable to report positivity based on a single test result. If both treponemal and non-treponemal test results on an individual patient are available, then syphilis positivity should be defined as having positive results on both tests. Country should report predominant mode of testing (e.g., treponemal test only, non-treponemal test only,\u00a0 both treponemal and non-treponemal test positive, mixed testing methods, or unknown).\n\nMethod of estimation: Data from reporting and surveillance systems and special studies are collected nationally and regionally.

  "PercposMSM": "Rationale: Men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise a high-risk group for STI disease burden. Syphilis infection in MSM's is a marker of syphilis prevalence in the community, and thus a measure of the effectiveness of the STI-prevention programme. This indicator is useful in measuring overall burden of disease and may provide early warning of potential changes in HIV transmission in the general population.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of men who have sex with men (MSM) with active syphilis.\nNumerator: Number of MSM who tested positive for syphilis.\nDenominator: Number of MSM who were tested for syphilis.\n\nMethod of measurement: The traditional approach to determining seroprevalence has been to screen with a non-treponemal test that measures reaginic antibody (e.g., VDRL or RPR) and confirm positive results with a treponemal test that measures treponemal antibody (e.g, TPHA, TPPA, EIA, or rapid treponemal test). Newer, rapid treponemal tests are comparatively easy to use, which encourages the use of these tests for screening, ideally paired with a non-treponemal test that detects reaginic antibody. Whichever approach is used, the proposed indicator requires both a positive non-treponemal test AND a positive treponemal test to give a proxy for active infection. If RPR testing is performed, it should be titrated and be >1:8 to be certain of active syphilis.\nJust a non-treponemal test, or just a treponemal test, while useful in some situations for therapeutic purposes, is not sufficiently specific for surveillance of MSM. The requirement for both a positive non-treponemal test and a positive treponemal test in MSM differs from the indicator on syphilis testing in antenatal care attendees because MSM are more likely to have a history of previous infection. A positive treponemal test measures lifetime exposure, whereas the non-treponemal test is a better indicator of active infection.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS jointly collect these data through the Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting (GARPR) System.",

This indicator is useful in measuring overall burden of disease and may provide early warning of potential changes in HIV transmission in the general population.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of sex workers (SW's) with active syphilis.\nNumerator: Number of SW's who tested positive for syphilis.\nDenominator: Number of SW's who were tested for syphilis.\n\nMethod of measurement: The traditional approach to determining seroprevalence has been to screen with a non-treponemal test that measures reaginic antibody (e.g., VDRL or RPR) and confirm positive results with a treponemal test that measures treponemal antibody (e.g, TPHA, TPPA, EIA, or rapid treponemal test). Newer, rapid treponemal tests are comparatively easy to use, a feature which encourages the use of these tests for screening, ideally paired with a non-treponemal test that detects reaginic antibody. Whichever approach is used, the proposed indicator requires both a positive non-treponemal test AND a positive treponemal test to give a proxy for active infection. If RPR testing is performed, it should be titrated and be >1:8 to be certain of active syphilis.\nJust a non-treponemal test, or just a treponemal test, while useful in some situations for therapeutic purposes, is not sufficiently specific for surveillance of sex workers. The requirement for both a positive non-treponemal test and a positive treponemal test in sex workers differs from the indicator on syphilis testing in antenatal care attendees because sex workers are more likely to have a history of previous infection. A positive treponemal test measures lifetime exposure, whereas the non-treponemal test is a better indicator of active infection.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data from reporting and surveillance systems and special studies are collected nationally and regionally. WHO compiles this data through its system of monitoring and reporting on global progress in countries' health sector responses toward universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. WHO, UNICEF, and UNAIDS jointly collect these data through the Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting (GARPR) System.",
  "PerctestedANC": "Rationale: Syphilis testing and treatment sufficiently early in pregnancy can effectively prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by maternal syphilis exposure, and is the core intervention in control of congenital syphilis. Syphilis testing is part of the recommended basic antenatal services package; thus, testing of antenatal care attendees for syphilis is also a marker of the quality of provision of essential antenatal care services.\n\nDefinition: What it measures: Percentage of women accessing antenatal care (ANC) services who were tested for syphilis\n\tNumerator:\tNumber of women attending ANC services who were tested for syphilis\n\tDenominator: \tNumber of women attending ANC services\n\nMethod of measurement: All pregnant women should be tested (\"screened\") for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit. Countries unable to distinguish first visit from subsequent visits can still report data on this indicator, but should clearly comment on this difference when reporting the data. Either non-treponemal tests that measure reaginic antibody (e.g., VDRL or RPR) or treponemal tests that measure treponemal antibody (e.g., TPHA, TPPA, EIA or rapid treponemal tests) may be used for screening. For this indicator simply being tested by either type of test is sufficient.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data from routine programmatic studies and reporting systems are collected nationally and regionally.

  "ROTAC": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of surviving infants who received the final recommended dose of rotavirus vaccine,\nwhich can be either the 2nd or the 3rd dose depending on the vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.   \n\t\n\tHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of surviving infants who received the final recommended dose of rotavirus vaccine, which can be either the 2nd or the 3rd dose depending on the vaccine.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods.\n\n\tThe estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics: \n\t\n\tCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated. \n\n\tConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.   When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.   \n\n\n\tRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.   \n\n\n\tNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.   \n\n\n\tLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.   \n\n\n\tDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.   \n\n\tPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted .",

  "RSUD_5": "Rationale: The WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study measures the burden of disease using the disability-adjusted life year metric (DALY). The DALY metric was developed to assess the burden of disease consistently across diseases, risk factors and regions. A consistent and comparative description of the burden of diseases and injuries and the risk factors that cause them is important as it can inform health decision-making and health care planning.\n\nDefinition: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is a time-based measure combining years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health (YLD). Therefore, DALYs for alcohol use disorders as well as for drug use disorders are defined and calculated as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u201chealthy\u201d life and the burden of disease as a measurement of the gap between the current health of a population and an ideal situation where everyone in the population lives into old age in full health. DALYS for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders\u00a0include age-weighting and time discounting. 3% discounting and non-uniform age weighting was used, resulting in less weight given to years lived at young and older ages.\n\nMethod of estimation: See Global Burden of Disease study, 2004.",

It is helpful in understanding whether those who actually drink alcohol consume high or low levels of alcohol. This has direct implications for the drinking population's health outcome.\n\nDefinition: Heavy episodic drinking (drinkers only)\u00a0is defined as the proportion of adult drinkers (15+ years) who have had at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. A consumption of 60 grams of pure alcohol corresponds approximately to 6 standard alcoholic drinks. Numerator: The appropriately weighted number of drinkers (15+ years) who reported drinking at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Denominator: The total number of respondents (15+ years, appropriately weighted) to the corresponding survey question(s) who reported having consumed an alcoholic standard drink (10 grams) within the past 12 months on the same survey (or 1-abstainers). This indicator is available for the population 15+ years, as well as for the age group 15-19 years.\n\nMethod of measurement: See heavy episodic drinking\n\nMethod of estimation: Weighted percentages of survey respondents, who reported having consumed an alcoholic drink within the past 12 months.",
  "SA_0000001417": "Rationale: Frequency, quantity and circumstances are important aspects of alcohol consumption to monitor as these patterns of drinking have been linked to mortality and burden of disease. Patterns of drinking are summarized in the patterns of drinking score.\n\nDefinition: The patterns of drinking score reflects the alcohol-attributable burden of disease of a country, given the same level of alcohol consumption, on a scale of 1 (least risky drinking pattern) to 5 (most risky drinking pattern) [2 (somewhat risky), 3\u00a0(medium risky), 4 (very risky)]. The higher the score, the higher the alcohol-attributable burden of disease for the country. It is based on three different dimensions: four different aspects of heavy drinking occasions (i.e. high usual quantity of alcohol per occasion, festive drinking common at fiestas or community celebrations, proportion of drinking when drinkers get drunk, and proportions of drinker who drink daily or nearly daily), drinking with meals, and drinking in public places.\n\nMethod of measurement: The original (1-4) indicator for patterns of drinking had been developed with optimal scaling methods based on surveys. An additional score of 5 was allocated to indicate countries, where more than 2/3 of the alcohol is consumed in heavy drinking occasions.

For countries without or with insufficient survey information, key informant information was used. The following main areas of patterns of drinking were included into the indicator \"pattern score\", as they all could be described as having one underlying dimension: different aspects of heavy drinking occasions, drinking with meals, and drinking in public places. To simplify the \"pattern score\" (named \"patterns of drinking score\" in the database), which ranged from 0 to 17 points, into robust general categories, the countries were classified into four categories and assigned values from 1 (least risky drinking pattern) to 4 (most risky drinking pattern). A \"pattern score\" of 1 was assigned to 0-3 points, 2 = 4-6 points, 3 = 7-9 points, and 4 = 10-17 points. The higher the \"pattern score\", the greater the alcohol-attributable burden of disease.

Tourist consumption takes into account tourists visiting the country and inhabitants visiting other countries.\n\nMethod of measurement: Recorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol consumed according to the official statistics at country level based on production, import, export, and sales or taxation data. When government national statistics are not available, country-specific alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on interviews or fieldwork are used; otherwise, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' statistical database (FAOSTAT) are used, or data from alcohol industry statistics in the public domain based on desk review.\n\t\n\tUnrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). When nationally representative empirical data (which are often general population surveys in countries where alcohol is legal) are not available, specific other empirical investigations, or expert opinion supported by periodic surveys of experts at country level using modified Delphi-technique, are used.\n\n\tThe litres of alcohol consumed by tourists (15 years of age or older) in a country are based on the number of tourists who visited a country, the average amount of time they spent in the country, and how much these people drink on average in their countries of origin (estimated based on per capita consumption of recorded and unrecorded alcohol). Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years or older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin). These estimations assumes the following: (1) that people drink the same amounts of alcohol when they are tourists as they do in their home countries, and (2) that global tourist consumption is equal to 0 (and thus tourist consumption can be either net negative or positive).Tourist consumption is based on UN statistics, and data are provided by IHME.\n\nMethod of estimation: The total APC in 2016 was calculated from a three-year average of recorded (for 2015, 2016, and 2017) per capita consumption and applying unrecorded proportion (for 2016) and tourist consumption (for 2016).\n\t\n\tFor recorded alcohol consumption, if data did not already exist for 2015, 2016 and/or 2017, the relevant years were projected using a linear regression model employing recorded alcohol per capita consumption data since 2012.\n\t\n\tUnrecorded alcohol consumption was estimated as a percentage of total alcohol consumption. Country-level proportions of unrecorded alcohol consumption were estimated using a regression analysis. Fractional response random intercepts regression models which accounted for clustering of data points within countries were used to estimate what percentage of total alcohol consumption was due to unrecorded alcohol consumption. Univariate models were fitted for alcohol consumption statistics (the prevalence of drinking, recorded litres of alcohol consumed per capita per year, patterns of drinking scores, value added and excise taxation of alcoholic beverages, presence of a written national alcohol policy, presence of national legislation to prevent illegal production and/or the sale of home or informally produced alcoholic beverages, and alcohol prohibition measures) and other predictors (urbanization, migration rates, malnutrition, sanitation, education levels, and per capita gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity). Backward and forward selection (using a significance cut-off level of 0.2) was used in combination with out-of-sample predictions (multiple random 10% sub-samples) and plausibility checks to assess model fit. Covariate data for 2016 were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Bank.\n\t\n\tTourist consumption of alcohol are the litres of pure alcohol which are purchased and consumed by tourists to a country. This figure is adjusted for the alcohol purchased and consumed when people are visiting countries other than their home country.

Furthermore, tourist alcohol consumption also accounts for the inhabitants of a country consuming alcohol while visiting other countries (based on the average time spent outside of their country (for all people 15 years or older) and the amount of alcohol consumed in their country of origin).

The prevalence of this condition in a given population is therefore useful in establishing the relative level of the number of individuals dying from heavy alcohol use. Alcohol is a frequent contributor to cancer and fatal road traffic crashes.\n\n\tThese are therefore important in evaluating, in an indirect way, alcohol-related mortalities and health outcomes generally.\n\nDefinition: The age-standardized death rate for these conditions is defined as the number of individuals in a given population who died from cancer, liver cirrhosis or road traffic crashes, respectively (codes according to ICD-10), during a calendar year. Death rates are age-standardized by the WHO standard population.\n\n\tNumerator:\n\tThe total number of deaths from the respective condition as mentioned above during a calendar year, among the country's population.\n\n\tDenominator:\n\tWhenever available, population data as provided by the countries; in the absence of reported population data, the estimated population data prepared by the United Nations Population Division are used.\n\nMethod of estimation: The numbers of deaths per 100,000 population are influenced by the age\ndistribution of the population. Two populations with the same age-specific mortality rates for a particular cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their populations are different. Age-standardized mortality rates adjust for differences in the age distribution of the population by applying the observed age-specific mortality rates for each population to a standard population. Hence the age standardized mortality rate is a weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates per 100,000 persons, where the weights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age group of the WHO standard population. Age-standardized death rates were calculated for population 15 years and over.",

For example if the purpose is to estimate national childhood hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission (including mother-to-child transmission) then the sampling should be geographically representative of the population. Convenience sampling is not appropriate. The sample size should be adequate to show with 95% confidence HBsAg prevalence of less than 1% with a precision of \u00b1 0.5%. The target age is 5-years-old. Sampling 4\u20136 year olds may be appropriate. The serosurvey is cross sectional and therefore a point estimate time. The shorter time periods of data collection are therefore preferred. Data on HepB birth dose exposure and HepB3 completion should be drawn from official records. Where these are not available testing for HBsAb may be considered for the serosurvey. This is less preferable as it is more costly, but can also be done in addition. Specimen collection and transportation should be appropriate to minimize bias though specimen degradation in rural and remote areas. Where possible, it is advantageous to collect blood specimens for ELISA laboratory testing because the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) is higher than for rapid tests. However in some locations only rapid tests will be available hence test selection is resource dependent. This should be considered in designing overall study methodology. When an appropriate sampling strategy and size are used and quality testing assays and laboratory procedures are employed, the HBsAg prevalence in the serosurvey should be representative of the incidence of childhood HBV transmission in the specific geographic region (or country) in this age group.\n\nMethod of estimation: HBsAg is the most important input into estimation of Hepatitis B incidence which is defined as number of new hepatitis B infections per 100 000 population in a given year.

Reported data on malaria cases generally need to be adjusted for extent of health service use (treatment seeking), underreporting and lack of case confirmation (the likelihood that cases are parasite positive). WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of malaria and suspects tested by microscopy or RDT, submitted by national malaria control programmes. Underreporting is reported or estimated by countries. Extent of health service use (treatment seeking) data were obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health service use.\n\nMethod of estimation: Confirmed malaria cases for countries and areas outside Africa, and for low-transmission countries and areas in Africa are adjusted for extent of health service use (treatment seeking), underreporting and lack of case confirmation (the likelihood that cases are parasite positive). In high transmission areas in which the quality of surveillance data does not permit a robust estimate from the number of reported cases, but good data on parasite prevalence is available, the number of cases can be estimated from parasite prevalence. The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population data. The range in brackets shown with the point estimate in the data tables represent the 95% uncertainty interval.",
  "SDGNTDTREATMENT": "Rationale: The average annual number of people requiring treatment and care for NTDs is the number that is expected to decrease toward \u201cthe end of NTDs\u201d by 2030 (target 3.3), as NTDs are eradicated, eliminated or controlled. The number of people requiring other interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are expected to need to be maintained beyond 2030 and are therefore to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. \r\n \r\nThis number should not be interpreted as the number of people at risk for NTDs. It is in fact a subset of the larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention \u2013 that is, treatment and care for NTDs.\n\nDefinition: Number of people requiring treatment and care for any one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) targeted by the WHO NTD Roadmap and World Health Assembly resolutions and reported to WHO.\n\nMethod of estimation: Some estimation is required to aggregate data across interventions and diseases. There is an established methodology that has been tested and an agreed international standard.

People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced. \r\n \r\n2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available. \r\n \r\nPopulations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach.",

  "SDGTOBACCO": "Rationale: Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis. Tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and all forms of smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco. Tobacco products exclude e-cigarettes (which do not contain tobacco), \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",
  "SDGWSHBOD": "Rationale: As part of a broader project to assess major risk factors to health, the burden of disease resulting from exposure to water, sanitation and hygiene was assessed, focusing on unsafe WASH services. The share of population using safely managed water and sanitation services are addressed in Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. In low-income countries, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene are important risks to health.\n\nDefinition: Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 100,000 population. Death rates are calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total population. Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene habits is, among others, directly linked to diarrhoeal diseases and intestinal nematode infections and other diseases. Repeated diarrhoea episodes are linked to protein-energy malnutrition. In this estimate, only the impact of diarrhoeal diseases, intestinal nematode infections, and protein-energy malnutrition are taken into account. The included diseases are the WASH attributable portions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10 code B76-B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46).\n\nMethod of estimation: Attributable diarrhoea deaths are calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (in this case, the percentage of the population with exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and lack of hygiene). This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed\u00a0 to the exposure, in this case lack of access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene. Applying this fraction to the total deaths from diarrhoea results in the number of diarrhoea deaths that results from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene. Deaths from protein-energy malnutrition attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene are estimated by evaluating the impacts of repeated infectious diarrhoea episodes on nutritional status (in particular stunting). All deaths from intestinal nematode infections are attributed to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene due to their transmission pathway.\n\tThe methods with agreed international standard have been developed, reviewed and published in various documents:  http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases-risks/gbd_poor_water/en/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255749/",

  "SG_REG_CENSUS": "Rationale: Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data needed for formulating,\nimplementing and monitoring policies and programmes aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development\u00a0and environmental sustainability. Population and housing censuses are an important source for supplying\u00a0disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\u00a0Development, especially in the context of assessing the situation of people by income, sex, age, race,\nethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics.\n\u00a0\nIn recognition of the above, the ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020\u00a0World\u00a0Population and Housing Census Programme urges Member States to conduct at least one population and\u00a0housing census during the period from 2015 to 2024, taking into account international and regional\nrecommendations relating to population and housing\ncensuses and giving particular attention to advance\nplanning, cost efficiency, coverage and the timely dissemination of, and easy access to, census results for\u00a0national stakeholders, the United Nations and other appropriate intergovernmental organizations\u00a0in\norder to inform decisions and facilitate the effective implementation of development plans and programmes.\n\u00a0\nThe indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing\ncensus in the last 10 years and hence\u00a0provides information on the availability of disaggregated population\u00a0and housing data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nDefinition: The indicator tracks the proportion of countries that have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years. This also includes countries which compile their detailed population and housing statistics from population registers, administrative records, sample surveys or other sources or a combination of those sources.\n\nMethod of estimation: ECOSOC resolution E/RES/2015/10 establishing the 2020 World Population and Housing Census\u00a0\nProgramme requests the Secretary\n-\nGeneral to \"monitor and regularly report to the Statistical Commission on the implementation of the Programme\". In response to this request UNSD regularly monitors the progress of implementation of population and housing censuses across Member States.\u00a0\nUNSD sends a survey to all countries soliciting detailed metadata on census methods at three points \u00a0(beginning, mid, end) over the 10-year spanning a census decade (currently the 2020 census round covering the years 2015-2024). In addition, information is also collected through the annual questionnaires sent to countries as part of the UN Demographic Yearbook collection.",

  "SI_POV_DAY1": "Rationale: Monitoring poverty is important\non the global development agenda as well as on the national\u00a0development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for\u00a0\ndeveloping countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using househ\nold\u00a0\nsurvey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been\u00a0\nconsiderable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys.\u00a0\nThe World Bank's Development Research Group maintain\ns a database that is updated annually as new\u00a0\nsurvey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major\u00a0\nreassessment of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that\u00a0\nall\nows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day global, regional and\u00a0\ncountry\n-\nlevel poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for\u00a0\ndifferent poverty lines.\u00a0\nThe Poverty and Equity Data p\nortal provides access to the database and user\n-\nfriendly dashboards with\u00a0\ngraphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different\u00a0\nregions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measure\ns based on the national\u00a0\npoverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent with PovcalNet.\n\nDefinition: The indicator Proportion of population below the international poverty line is defined as\u00a0the percentage of the population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices. The 'international poverty line' is currently set at $1.90 a day at 2011 international prices.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data are taken from the United Nations' SDG Indicators Global Database. See links below for \u00a0more information.\nTo measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank\u2019s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what \u201cpoverty\u201d means in the world\u2019s poorest countries.\u00a0\nThe current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption.\u00a0\nWhen measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI).\u00a0\n(Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year,\u00a0\nand then converted to PPP $\u2019s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI.

These  environmental contributions have been estimated by country and aggregated for regions, by age group, by gender and by disease.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of total DALYs that are attributable to the environment.\nIt represents burden of disease that could be avoided by modifying the environment. \nModifiable environment includes:\n- Air, soil and water pollution with chemicals or biological agents\n- Ultraviolet and ionizing radiation\n- Built environment\n- Noise, electromagnetic fields\n- Occupational risks\n- Agricultural methods, irrigation schemes\n- Anthropogenic climate changes, ecosystem degradation\n- Individual behaviors related to the environment; such as hand-washing, food contamination with unsafe water or dirty hands.\n\nMethod of estimation: The results are based on a combination of (a) Comparative Risk Assessments; (b) calculations based on more limited epidemiological data; (c) entire attribution of certain diseases to the environment based on their transmission pathway; and (c) surveys of expert opinions on the attributable fractions for some environmental risks. Attributable fractions were estimated for 92 out of the 133 major diseases and injuries quantified by WHO. The figures represent the sum of all the attributable DALYs.",

The WHO Programme of Nutrition, Physical Activity adn Obesity, at the Regional Office for Europe compiles country information on exclusive breastfeeding independently.

WHO has developed a model life table using a modified logit system based on about 1800 life tables from vital registration judged to be of good quality to project life tables and to estimate life table using limited number of parameter as input. \n\u00a0\n1) When mortality data from civil registration are available, their quality is assessed; they are adjusted for the level of completeness of registration if necessary and they are directly used to construct the life tables. \n\u00a0\n2) When mortality data from civil registration for the latest year are not available, the life tables are projected from available years.\u00a0Estimated under-5 mortality rates and adult mortality rates, or from under-5 mortality rates only, using a modified logit model to which a global standard (defined as the average of all the 1800 life tables) is applied. \n\u00a0\n3) When no useable data from civil registration are available, the latest life table analyses of the UN population Division were used. \n\u00a0\nPredominant type of statistics: Predicted",

  "WHS2_152": "Rationale: Information on malaria death rates can help to judge the success of program implementation, and may point to failures of programs in terms of prevention of malaria or access to effective treatment.\u00a0\n\nMalaria is not only important in its own right but the disease can contribute to deaths arising from other conditions.\u00a0 In addition, malaria imposes an economic burden on families particularly those who are least able to pay for prevention and treatment and most affected by loss of income due to the disease. The disease also represents a financial burden to malaria-endemic countries that must use scarce resources to fund bednets, insecticides and drugs in an effort to control the disease.\n\nDefinition: The number of deaths due to malaria per 100 000 population per year.\n\nMethod of estimation: The World Health Organization (WHO) is the agency responsible for these indicators at the international level. It compiles information supplied by the Ministries of Health, the agencies responsible for malaria surveillance in endemic countries.\n\nThe procedures for adjusting data to allow international comparability are as follows. The number of malaria deaths is derived by one of two methods: \n(i) by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases in a country by a fixed case-fatality rate. This method is used for all countries outside the African Region and for countries in the African Region where estimates of case incidence are derived from routine reporting systems and where malaria comprises less than 5% of all deaths in children under 5 as described in the Global Burden of Disease Incremental Revision for 2004 (GBD 2004).\u00a0 A case fatality rate of 0.45% is applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases for countries in the African Region and a case fatality rate of 0.3% for P. falciparum cases in other regions. (In situations where the fraction of all deaths due to malaria deaths is small, the use of a case fatality rate in conjunction with estimates of case incidence is considered to provide a better guide to the levels of malaria mortality than attempts to estimate the fraction of deaths due to malaria.) \n(ii) For countries in the African Region where malaria comprises 5% or more of all deaths in children under 5, the number of deaths are derived from an estimate of the number of people living at high, low or no risk of malaria. Malaria deaths rates for these populations are inferred from longitudinal studies of malaria deaths as recorded in the published literature.\n\nThe malaria death rate is expressed as the number of deaths due to malaria per 100 000 population per year with the population of a country derived from projections made by the UN Population Division.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe adjustment procedures as described above aim to take into account underreporting of cases in countries due to patients not using public sector facilities, or gaps in public sector reporting systems.\u00a0 For some countries, that do not undertake laboratory conformation of cases, the adjustments also aim to correct for over-diagnosis of malaria.\u00a0 Where data from surveillance systems are not available, or considered to be of insufficient quality, incidence is derived from estimated levels of malaria risk and will mostly be a different source from locally available estimates.\n\nPredominant type of statistics:\u00a0predicted",

  "WHS4_100": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\n\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12\u201323 months who received three doses of the combined diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine time before the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\n\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\n\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data.

Appropriate care of the sick child is defined as providers that can correctly diagnose and treat pneumonia. The proportion of under-fives with ARI that are taken to an appropriate health-care provider is therefore a key indicator for coverage of intervention and care-seeking, and provides critical inputs to the monitoring of progress towards child survival-related Sustainable Development Goals and related strategies.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of children under 5 years of age with symptoms of pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or provider.\n\nMethod of measurement: Mothers or caregivers of children under five years of age are asked if the child had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI),  and if so, whether treatment was sought and where it was sought.   During the UNICEF/WHO Meeting on Child Survival Survey-based Indicators, held in New York, USA, on 17\u201318 June 2004, it was recommended that suspected ARI be described as \u201cpresumed pneumonia\u201d to better reflect the probable cause and the recommended interventions. The definition of ARI used in the DHS and MICS was chosen by the group and is based on the mother\u2019s perceptions of a child who has a cough, is breathing faster than usual with short, quick breaths or is having difficulty breathing, excluding children who had only a blocked nose.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data are taken from UNICEF database (see link below), which compiled data from household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).",

Household surveys used include: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); WHO-supported World Health Surveys (WHS); and other reliable and nationally representative country surveys.\n\nMethod of estimation: The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices from about 800 nationally representative data sources such as the ones listed above is used.\nUnless stated otherwise, solid fuel use (SFU) estimates for the total, urban and rural population for a given year were obtained separately using a multilevel model. The model only accounts for\u00a0 regions, countries and time as a spline function, and SFU estimates were restricted to values ranging from zero to one. More details on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, EHP, 121(7), 2013).\u00a0 All analyses were conducted using STATA software (version 12, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). \n\u00a0\nEstimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as follows:\n- \u00a0When no solid fuel use information was available for the country, the regional population-weighted mean was used. Note that this approach was aslo applied to Equatorial Guinea instead of the one used for high-income countries (see below).\n- Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita (The World Bank, http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications, accessed July, 2014) are assumed to have made a complete transition to using non-solid fuels as the primary source of domestic energy for cooking and heating, and solid fuel use is reported to be less than 5% (Rehfuess, Mehta & Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn, EHP, 114(3), 2006).",

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, killing nearly eight million people a year. Yet about one-third of these lives could be saved if cancer is detected and treated early. Three-quarters of cancer deaths occur in developing countries where the resources needed to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer are severely limited or nonexistent. Consequently, it is important to know the gaps in availability in order to find programmes to improve accessibility.\u00a0 As a result, WHO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have created a Joint Programme on Cancer Control focusing on the needs of radiotherapy equipment in developing countries.\n\nDefinition: Number of radiotherapy units, including Linear Accelerators and Cobalt-60 from the public and private sectors, per 1 000 000 population.\n\nMethod of measurement: Count of medical devices available in the country, divided by the number of population.\n\nMethod of estimation: Information collected directly from country focal points from  ministries of health through the baseline country survey on medical devices 2013 update, conducted by HQ/HIS/EMP/PAU.\nIn case of non-response, Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC) International Atomic Energy Agency data was used.\nThe population data was obtained from World Population Prospects 2012 Revision (2013 medium estimates)\nPredominant type of statistics: Unadjusted.",

  "WHS8_110": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\nPercentage of children under one year of age immunized against measles is one of MDG indicators.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of children under one year of age who have received at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine in a given year. \n\nFor countries recommending the first dose of measles vaccine in children over 12 months of age, the indicator is calculated as the proportion of children less than 12-23 months of age receiving one dose of measles-containing vaccine.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\n\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12\u201323 months who received at least one dose of measles vaccine either any time before the survey or before the age of 12 months.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\n\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\n\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.\n\nWhen faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\n\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\n\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\n\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\n\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\",, by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\n\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted",

  "W-MM_Group": "Rationale: In 2008, WHO introduced the MPOWER package to assist in the country-level implementation of six effective measures to reduce demand for tobacco products. Each measure reflects at least one provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The letter W in MPOWER denotes the \"Warn about the dangers of tobacco\" measure. The media play a key role in shaping tobacco-related knowledge, opinions, attitudes and behaviours, and can be extremely powerful in influencing both individuals and policy-makers regarding tobacco use and tobacco control issues.

  "WSH_HYGIENE_BASIC": "Rationale: Hygiene has long-established links with public health, and the explicit reference to hygiene in the text of SDG target 6.2 represents increasing recognition of the importance of hygiene and its close links with sanitation. Hygiene is multi-faceted and can comprise many behaviours, including handwashing, menstrual hygiene and food hygiene. International consultations among WASH sector professionals identified handwashing with soap and water as a top priority in all settings, and also as a suitable indicator for national and global monitoring.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of population living in households that have a handwashing facility with soap and water at home.  Handwashing facilities can consist of a sink with tap water, but can also include other devices that contain, transport or regulate the flow of water. Buckets with taps, tippy-taps and portable basins are all examples of handwashing facilities. Bar soap, liquid soap, powder detergent and soapy water all count as soap for monitoring purposes.\n\nMethod of measurement: Household surveys routinely collect information on the availability of handwashing facilities in the home. In most cases, the enumerator asks to see the place where members of the household most often wash their hands. The enumerator then observes if water and soap are available at that place. Household-level responses, weighted by household size, are used to compute population coverage.\n\nMethod of estimation: The JMP assembles, reviews and assesses national data collected by statistics offices and other relevant institutions including sectoral authorities. Linear regression is used to provide estimates of the population with handwashing facilities at home, as well as the proportion with handwashing facilities where soap and water were observed. \r\n\tSeparate estimates are made for urban and rural areas, and national estimates are generated as weighted averages of the two, using population data from the most recent report of the United Nations Population Division. \r\n\tThe most recent household survey or census available for most countries was typically conducted two to six years ago.

A household can also experience impoverishing health spending if its consumption before spending out of pocket was already below the poverty line; it is further impoverished after spending out of pocket.\n\nOut-of-pocket payments are defined according to the International Classification for Health Accounts as formal and informal payments made at the time of using any health care good or service provided by any type of provider; including user charges (co-payments) for covered services and direct payments for non-covered services; and excluding any pre-payment in the form of taxes, contributions or insurance premiums and any reimbursement by a third party such as the government, a health insurance fund or a private insurance company.\n\nThe poverty line is a country-specific relative poverty line (basic needs line) based on household spending to meet basic needs (food, housing and utilities). It is calculated as the average amount spent on food, housing (rent) and utilities (water, electricity and fuel used for cooking and heating) by households between the 25th and 35th percentiles of the household consumption distribution who report any spending on each item, respectively, adjusted for household size and composition using OECD equivalence scales.

  "M_Est_smk_curr": "Rationale: Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any smoked tobacco product, as estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \u201cCurrent\u201d means either daily or non-daily (occasional) use at the time of the survey. Smoked tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and any other form of smoked tobacco. Smoked tobacco products exclude smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco products and products that do not contain tobacco, such as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) of which e-cigarettes are a common type, as well as \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d. \"Crude-adjusted\" means the estimate was modelled as described below, and not age-standardized. Non-age-standardized estimates allow the calculation of the number of tobacco users in the country, but do not allow comparison with other countries, since different age structures in countries can affect comparability.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression was used to model prevalence of tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women, by age group and tobacco type. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries in the same UN subregion to fill information gaps. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a prevalence rate can be reported for each year even if the country did not run a survey every year. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys completed in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated.",

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_NONPREGNANT_PREV": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia  in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "M_Est_cig_daily_std": "Rationale: Adjusted and age-standardized prevalence rates are constructed solely for the purpose of comparing tobacco use prevalence estimates across multiple countries or across multiple time periods for the same country. These rates should not be used to estimate the number of smokers in the population.\n\nDefinition: Prevalence estimates for daily smoking of cigarettes are age-standardized rates for adults aged 15 years and over, estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. The definition of \"daily cigarette smoking\" varies between surveys, but often means current smoking of cigarettes at least once a day.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO has developed a regression method that attempts to enable comparisons between countries. If data are partly missing or are incomplete for a country, the regression technique uses data available for the region in which the country is located to generate estimates for that country. The regression models are run at the United Nations sub-regional level 3 separately for males and females in order to obtain age-specific prevalence rates for that region. These estimates are then substituted for the country falling within the sub-region for the missing indicator. Note that the technique cannot be used for countries without any data: these countries are excluded from any analysis.\nInformation from heterogeneous sources that originate from different surveys and do not employ standardized survey instruments render difficult the production of national-level age-standardized rates. The four types of differences between surveys and the relevant adjustment procedures used are listed below.\nDifferences in age groups covered by the survey:\nIn order to estimate smoking prevalence rates for standard age ranges (by five-year groups from age 15 until age 80 and thereafter from 80 to 100 years), the association between age and daily smoking is examined for males and females separately for each country using scatter plots. For this exercise, data from the latest nationally representative survey are chosen; in some cases more than one survey is chosen if male and female prevalence rates stem from different surveys or if the additional survey supplements data for the extreme age intervals. To obtain age-specific prevalence rates for five-year age intervals, regression models using daily smoking prevalence estimates from a first order, second order and third order function of age are graphed against the scatter plot and the best fitting curve is chosen. For the remaining indicators, a combination of methods is applied: regression models are run at the sub-regional level to obtain age-specific rates for current and daily cigarette smoking, and an equivalence relationship is applied between smoking prevalence rates and cigarette smoking where cigarette smoking is dominant to obtain age-specific prevalence rates for current and daily cigarette smoking for the standard age intervals.\nDifferences in the types of indicators of tobacco use measured:\nIf we have data for current tobacco smoking and current cigarette smoking, then definitional adjustments are made to account for the missing daily tobacco smoking and daily cigarette smoking. Likewise, if we have data for current and daily tobacco smoking only, then tobacco type adjustments are made across tobacco types to generate estimates for current and daily cigarette smoking.\nDifferences in geographic coverage of the survey within the country:\nAdjustments are made to the data by observing the prevalence relationship between urban and rural areas in countries falling within the relevant sub-region. Results from this urban-rural regression exercise are applied to countries to allow a scaling-up of prevalence to the national level. As an example, if a country has prevalence rates for daily smoking of tobacco in urban areas only, the regression results from the rural-urban smoking relationship are used to obtain rural prevalence rates for daily smoking. These are then combined with urban prevalence rates using urban-rural population ratios as weights to generate a national prevalence estimate as well as national age-specific rates.\nDifferences in survey year:\nFor the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2009, smoking prevalence estimates were generated for year 2006. Smoking prevalence data are sourced from surveys conducted in countries in different years. In some cases, the latest available prevalence data came from surveys before the year 2006 while in other cases the survey was later than 2006. To obtain smoking prevalence estimates for 2006, trend information is used either to project into the future for countries with data older than 2006 or to backtrack for countries with data later than 2006. This is achieved by incorporating trend information from all available surveys for each country. For countries without historical data, trend information from the respective sub-region in which they fall is used.\nAge-standardized prevalence:\nTobacco use generally varies widely by sex and across age groups. Although the crude prevalence rate is reasonably easy to understand for a country at one point in time, comparing crude rates between two or more countries at one point in time, or of one country at different points in time, can be misleading if the two populations being compared have significantly different age distributions or differences in tobacco use by sex. The method of age-standardization is commonly used to overcome this problem and allows for meaningful comparison of prevalence between countries. The method involves applying the age-specific rates by sex in each population to one standard population. The WHO Standard Population, a fictitious population whose age distribution was artificially created and is largely reflective of the population age structure of low- and middle-income countries, was used. The resulting age-standardized rate, also expressed as a percentage of the total population, refers to the number of smokers per 100 WHO Standard Population. As a result, the rate generated using this process is only a hypothetical number with no inherent meaning in its magnitude. It is only useful when contrasting rates obtained from one country to those obtained in another country, or from the same country at a different points in time.\nIn order to produce an overall smoking prevalence rate for a country, the age-standardized prevalence rates for males and females must be combined to generate total prevalence. Since the WHO Standard Population is the same irrespective of sex, the age-standardized rates for males and females are combined using population weights for males and for females at the global level from the UN population data for 2006. For example, if the age-standardized prevalence rate for tobacco smoking in adults is 60% for males and 30% for females, the combined prevalence rate for tobacco smoking in all adults is calculated as 60 x (0.51) + 30 x (0.49) = 45%, with the figures in brackets representing male and female population weights. Thus, of the total smoking prevalence (45%) the proportion of smoking attributable to males is 66.7% [= (30 \u00f7 45) x 100] and to females 33.3% [= (15 \u00f7 45) x 100].",

It also provides an indication of the success of reproductive health programmes in addressing demand for services.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15\u221249 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods. \nNumerator: Number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union who use modern contraceptive methods. \nDenominator: Total number of women aged 15-49 who are married or in-union in need of family planning\nWomen who are married is defined in relation to the marriage laws or customs of a country and  women in a union refers to women living with their partner in the same household (also referred to as cohabiting unions, consensual unions, unmarried unions, or \u201cliving together\u201d.\nModern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intrauterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap, and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream, and sponge), the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM), emergency contraception, and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring).\n\nMethod of measurement: Household surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence use rate and demand for family planning. \nFor UHC, we use UNPD modelled estimates Those modelled data are available for married women, unmarried women and all women. This specific indicator refers to modelled data for married women only - for data comparability across countries and because data are available for all years.\nThe demand for family planning that is satisfied by using modern methods of contraception describes the number of women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) who are married or in a union who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method, as a proportion of the number of women of reproductive age who are married or in a union who have a demand for family planning.\n\nMethod of estimation: The United Nations Population Division produces a systematic and comprehensive series of annual estimates and projections of the percentage of demand for family planning that is satisfied among married or in-union women. A Bayesian hierarchical model combined with country-specific data is used to generate the estimates, projections and uncertainty assessments from survey data. The model accounts for differences by data source, sample population and contraceptive methods.\nSee more details: \n Methods for estimating and projecting key family planning indicators among all women of reproductive age  https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/technical/index.asp",

Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes.

  "M_Est_cig_curr_std": "Rationale: Adjusted and age-standardized prevalence rates are constructed solely for the purpose of comparing tobacco use prevalence estimates across multiple countries or across multiple time periods for the same country. These rates should not be used to estimate the number of smokers in the population.\n\nDefinition: Prevalence estimates for current smoking of cigarettes are age-standardized rates for adults aged 15 years and over, estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \u201cCurrent cigarette smoking\u201d includes both daily and non-daily or occasional cigarette smoking.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",

  "SDGFPALL": "Rationale: The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 per cent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 per cent or less are generally considered as very low.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next child and who are currently using a modern method of contraception.

Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.\n\nMethod of estimation: There is no attempt to provide estimates for individual countries or areas when country or area data are not available.\nThe numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method.

The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed below a poverty line by household health expenditures (with impoverishing health expenditures) is computed as the difference in the incidence of poverty based on household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income gross and net of health expenditures. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels.",

The minimum target for this indicator should be set by national or local governments, and many countries have made having 100% of deliveries in institutions their main strategy for reducing maternal mortality.\n\nDefinition: The proportion of births occurring in health facilities in the area, or \u2018institutional births\u2019 or \u2018institutional deliveries.\n\nMethod of measurement: For \u201cpopulation-based surveys\u201d: percentage of women who gave birth in a health facility (number of women who gave birth in a health facility/total number of live births in the same geographic/administrative area) x 100.\n \nFor \u201cfacility-based data\u201d: percentage of women who gave birth in a health facility (number of deliveries in facility/estimated total number of live births (or all births if available)) x 100.\nIn household surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and the Reproductive Health Surveys, the respondent is asked about each live birth and where the childbirth took place for a period up to five years (or three or two depending of survey type) before the interview. Service/facility records could be used where a high proportion of births occur in health facilities and therefore they are recorded.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data for global monitoring are collected by WHO. WHO obtains the data from national sources; both survey, facility and registry data. Before data can be included in the global databases, WHO undertakes a process of data verification that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions if needed.",
  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_NPRELPL_POP": "Definition: Proportion of the population pushed below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures corresponds to the change in the poverty headcount ratio due to household expenditure on health being included or excluded from the measure of household welfare, which can be either consumption or income. The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed below a poverty line by household health expenditures (with impoverishing health expenditures) is computed as the difference in the incidence of poverty based on household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income gross and net of health expenditures. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels.",

  "P_compl_p7": "Definition: The level of compliance with the law was measured by asking in-country experts to provide their assessments by interview. These experts included at least three, and up to five, of the following persons:\n\u2022 the most senior government official in charge of tobacco control or tobacco-related conditions;\n\u2022 the head of a prominent NGO dedicated to tobacco control; \n\u2022 a health professional (e.g. physician, nurse, pharmacist) specializing in tobacco-related conditions;\n\u2022 a staff member of a public health university department;\n\u2022 the Tobacco Free Initiative focal point at the WHO country office.\nAssessments were requested for each provision which is in place under a national law banning smoking in public places and enclosed workplaces.

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_CHILDREN_NUM": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia  in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Children aged 6\u221259 months with a haemoglobin concentration less than 110 g/L, adjusted for altitude.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "CHILDVIOL": "Rationale: Frequently viewed as a necessary part of raising children, the use of physical force or verbal intimidation is not only a violation of children\u2019s rights but has been shown to inflict short- and long-term harm such as poorer quality of parent\u2013child relationships, mental health problems (such as depression), increased child aggression, antisocial behavior and lower intellectual achievement.\n\nDefinition: Proportion of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month is currently being measured by the Proportion of children aged 1-14 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month.\n\nMethod of measurement: In Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), psychological aggression refers to the action of shouting, yelling or screaming at a child, as well as calling a child offensive names, such as \u2018dumb\u2019 or \u2018lazy\u2019. Physical (or corporal) punishment is an action intended to cause physical pain or discomfort, but not injuries. Physical punishment is defined as shaking the child, hitting or slapping him/her on the hand/arm/leg, hitting him/her on the bottom or elsewhere on the body with a hard object, spanking or hitting him/her on the bottom with a bare hand, hitting or slapping him/her on the face, head or ears, and beating him/her over and over as hard as possible.\n\nMethod of estimation: Number of children aged 1-17 years who are reported to have experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month divided by the total number of children aged 1-17 in the population multiplied by 100.\n\nProxy indicator:\nNumber of children aged 1-14 years who are reported to have experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month divided by the total number of children aged 1-14 in the population multiplied by 100.\n\nWhen data for a country are entirely missing, UNICEF does not publish any country-level data.",
  "SDGHPVRECEIVED": "Rationale: Immunization is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. It is a good indicator of health system performance.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of one-year-olds who have received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in a given year.\n\nMethod of measurement: Service/facility reporting system (\"administrative data\"): Reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (e.g. district health centres, vaccination teams, physicians) are used for estimates based on service/facility records. The estimate of immunization coverage is derived by dividing the total number of vaccinations given by the number of children in the target population, often based on census projections.\n\nHousehold surveys: Survey items correspond to children\u2019s history in coverage surveys. The principle types of surveys are the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) 30-cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The indicator is estimated as the percentage of children ages 12\u201323 months who received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine either any time before the survey.\n\nMethod of estimation: Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics:\n\nCountry\u2013specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not \"borrowed\" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated.\n\nConsistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear more reliable, coverage estimates are based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., \"international incidences\") the estimates reflect the impact of these events.\n\nWhen faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses., local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.\n\nRecall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi-dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker.\n\nNo coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%.\n\nLocal knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels.\n\nDescription and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are presented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are \"thickened\",, by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates.\n\nPredominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted",

There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any smoked tobacco product on a daily basis, as estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. The definition of \"daily\" varies between surveys, but often means current use at least once a day. Smoked tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and any other form of smoked tobacco. Smoked tobacco products exclude smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco products and products that do not contain tobacco, such as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) of which e-cigarettes are a common type, as well as \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d. \"Crude-adjusted\" means the estimate was modelled as described below, and not age-standardized. Non-age-standardized estimates allow the calculation of the number of tobacco users in the country, but do not allow comparison with other countries, since different age structures in countries can affect comparability.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression was used to model prevalence of tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women, by age group and tobacco type. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries in the same UN subregion to fill information gaps. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a prevalence rate can be reported for each year even if the country did not run a survey every year. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys completed in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated.",
  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_PG_RELPL_STD": "Definition: The increase in poverty gap due to household health expenditures corresponds to the increase in the mean shortfall of consumption or income from a relative poverty line attributable to household health expenditures (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall). The increase in the mean shortfall is expressed as a percentage of the relative poverty line.  The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union.\n\nMethod of estimation: Let\u2019s refer to household total consumption inclusive of household health spending as \u201cgross consumption\u201d and to household total consumption excluding household health spending as \u201cnet consumption\u201d. If income is used let\u2019s refer to \u201cnet income\u201d as household income less household expenditures on health and to \u201cgross income\u201d as household total income. Consumption is the preferred welfare measure and income should be only when consumption data is unavailable. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party like an insurer but exclude insurance premiums as Household expenditure on health correspond to out-of-pocket payments (OOPs - SHA 2011). Based on these concepts, the increase in the poverty gap due to household health expenditures is computed as the poverty gap based on \u201cnet consumption\u201d or \u201cnet income\u201d less the poverty gap based on \u201cgross consumption\u201d or \u201cgross income\u201d.  The poverty gap always corresponds to the mean shortfall in consumption (gross/net) or income (gross/net) from the poverty line (counting the nonpoor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. Differences in poverty gaps as defined here reflect then the increase in the mean shortfall in consumption or income due to household expenditures on health. The poverty gap always captures the depth of poverty as well as its incidence at the poverty line, hence difference in poverty gaps as defined here reflect both changes in the incidence of poverty due to household expenditures on health and changes in the depth of poverty due to health spending. The poverty line, is a relative one defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income. Household consumption expenditure or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain the (increase) in the mean shortfall of consumption/income per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty gaps at national and regional levels. This indicator is not an official SDG indicator per se but links SDG goal 3.8 on Universal health coverage directly to the first SDG goal on poverty eradication. It is an important complement to SDG indicator 3.8.2. To fully understand progress towards UHC it needs to be monitored jointly with SDG indicator 3.8.1.",

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_CHILDREN_PREV": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia  in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of children aged 6\u221259 months with a haemoglobin concentration less than 110 g/L, adjusted for altitude.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

  "M_Est_smk_daily_std": "Rationale: Adjusted and age-standardized prevalence rates are constructed solely for the purpose of comparing tobacco use prevalence estimates across multiple countries or across multiple time periods for the same country. These rates should not be used to estimate the number of smokers in the population.\n\nDefinition: Prevalence estimates for daily smoking of any tobacco product are age-standardized rates for adults aged 15 years and over, estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. \"Tobacco smoking\" includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes or any other smoked tobacco products. The definition of \"daily tobacco smoking\" varies between surveys, but often means current smoking of any tobacco product at least once a day.\n\nMethod of estimation: WHO has developed a regression method that attempts to enable comparisons between countries. If data are partly missing or are incomplete for a country, the regression technique uses data available for the region in which the country is located to generate estimates for that country. The regression models are run at the United Nations sub-regional level 3 separately for males and females in order to obtain age-specific prevalence rates for that region. These estimates are then substituted for the country falling within the sub-region for the missing indicator. Note that the technique cannot be used for countries without any data: these countries are excluded from any analysis.\nInformation from heterogeneous sources that originate from different surveys and do not employ standardized survey instruments render difficult the production of national-level age-standardized rates. The four types of differences between surveys and the relevant adjustment procedures used are listed below.\nDifferences in age groups covered by the survey:\nIn order to estimate smoking prevalence rates for standard age ranges (by five-year groups from age 15 until age 80 and thereafter from 80 to 100 years), the association between age and daily smoking is examined for males and females separately for each country using scatter plots. For this exercise, data from the latest nationally representative survey are chosen; in some cases more than one survey is chosen if male and female prevalence rates stem from different surveys or if the additional survey supplements data for the extreme age intervals. To obtain age-specific prevalence rates for five-year age intervals, regression models using daily smoking prevalence estimates from a first order, second order and third order function of age are graphed against the scatter plot and the best fitting curve is chosen. For the remaining indicators, a combination of methods is applied: regression models are run at the sub-regional level to obtain age-specific rates for current and daily cigarette smoking, and an equivalence relationship is applied between smoking prevalence rates and cigarette smoking where cigarette smoking is dominant to obtain age-specific prevalence rates for current and daily cigarette smoking for the standard age intervals.\nDifferences in the types of indicators of tobacco use measured:\nIf we have data for current tobacco smoking and current cigarette smoking, then definitional adjustments are made to account for the missing daily tobacco smoking and daily cigarette smoking. Likewise, if we have data for current and daily tobacco smoking only, then tobacco type adjustments are made across tobacco types to generate estimates for current and daily cigarette smoking.\nDifferences in geographic coverage of the survey within the country:\nAdjustments are made to the data by observing the prevalence relationship between urban and rural areas in countries falling within the relevant sub-region. Results from this urban-rural regression exercise are applied to countries to allow a scaling-up of prevalence to the national level. As an example, if a country has prevalence rates for daily smoking of tobacco in urban areas only, the regression results from the rural-urban smoking relationship are used to obtain rural prevalence rates for daily smoking. These are then combined with urban prevalence rates using urban-rural population ratios as weights to generate a national prevalence estimate as well as national age-specific rates.\nDifferences in survey year:\nFor the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, 2009, smoking prevalence estimates were generated for year 2006. Smoking prevalence data are sourced from surveys conducted in countries in different years. In some cases, the latest available prevalence data came from surveys before the year 2006 while in other cases the survey was later than 2006. To obtain smoking prevalence estimates for 2006, trend information is used either to project into the future for countries with data older than 2006 or to backtrack for countries with data later than 2006. This is achieved by incorporating trend information from all available surveys for each country. For countries without historical data, trend information from the respective sub-region in which they fall is used.\nAge-standardized prevalence:\nTobacco use generally varies widely by sex and across age groups. Although the crude prevalence rate is reasonably easy to understand for a country at one point in time, comparing crude rates between two or more countries at one point in time, or of one country at different points in time, can be misleading if the two populations being compared have significantly different age distributions or differences in tobacco use by sex. The method of age-standardization is commonly used to overcome this problem and allows for meaningful comparison of prevalence between countries. The method involves applying the age-specific rates by sex in each population to one standard population. The WHO Standard Population, a fictitious population whose age distribution was artificially created and is largely reflective of the population age structure of low- and middle-income countries, was used. The resulting age-standardized rate, also expressed as a percentage of the total population, refers to the number of smokers per 100 WHO Standard Population. As a result, the rate generated using this process is only a hypothetical number with no inherent meaning in its magnitude. It is only useful when contrasting rates obtained from one country to those obtained in another country, or from the same country at a different points in time.\nIn order to produce an overall smoking prevalence rate for a country, the age-standardized prevalence rates for males and females must be combined to generate total prevalence. Since the WHO Standard Population is the same irrespective of sex, the age-standardized rates for males and females are combined using population weights for males and for females at the global level from the UN population data for 2006. For example, if the age-standardized prevalence rate for tobacco smoking in adults is 60% for males and 30% for females, the combined prevalence rate for tobacco smoking in all adults is calculated as 60 x (0.51) + 30 x (0.49) = 45%, with the figures in brackets representing male and female population weights. Thus, of the total smoking prevalence (45%) the proportion of smoking attributable to males is 66.7% [= (30 \u00f7 45) x 100] and to females 33.3% [= (15 \u00f7 45) x 100].",

  "FINPROTECTION_IMP_NP_REL_LEVEL_SH": "Definition: Proportion of the population pushed below a relative poverty line by household health expenditures corresponds to the change in the poverty headcount ratio due to household expenditure on health being included or excluded from the measure of household welfare, which can be either consumption or income. The relative poverty line is defined as 60% of median daily per capita consumption or income in each country which comes closest to the relative poverty line used by Eurostat to monitor poverty in the European Union. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and the relative poverty line are all measured by their daily value per capita.\n\nMethod of estimation: The proportion of the population pushed below a poverty line by household health expenditures (with impoverishing health expenditures) is computed as the difference in the incidence of poverty based on household\u2019s total consumption expenditure or income gross and net of health expenditures. Household consumption or income, household expenditures on health, and poverty lines are all measured by their daily value per capita. Household expenditure on health are defined as formal and informal payments made at the time of getting any type of care (preventive, curative, rehabilitative, palliative or long-term care) provided by any type of provider. These payments include the part not covered by a third party such as the government, health insurance fund or private insurance but exclude insurance premiums as well as any reimbursement by a third party. They might be financed by income, including remittance, savings or borrowings. With this definition health expenditures are labelled Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments in the classification of health care financing schemes (HF) of the international Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA). Household\u2019s sample weight multiplied by the household size is used to obtain representative numbers per person. If the sample is self-weighting, then only the household size is used as the weight. Indicators of impoverishing spending on health are not part of the official SDG indicator of universal health coverage per se but relate UHC to the first SDG goal, namely end poverty in all its forms everywhere. The idea is that out-of-pocket payments divert household spending away from non-medical budget items such as food and shelter to such an extent that in some cases a household\u2019s position in relation to such a pre-defined poverty line before and after spending out-of-pocket on health changes. It is not possible to eliminate impoverishment due to out-of-pocket health spending using a relative poverty line, but it is possible to reduce it. To this end, out-of-pocket health expenditures should not be a major driver of economic disadvantage relative to others in the society. Ultimately the choice of the poverty line should be tailored to inform evidence-based policy changes at global, regional and national levels. The use of national and regional poverty lines is critical to fully understand the impact of out-of-pocket payments on poverty at national and regional levels.",

There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily basis, as estimated using the method described in the Method of Estimation below. The definition of \"daily\" varies between surveys, but often means current use at least once a day.  Tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and all forms of smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco. Tobacco products exclude products that do not contain tobacco, such as electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) of which e-cigarettes are a common type, as well as \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d. Age-standardization is a method to adjust a country's prevalence rate using the WHO standard population (applied to age-specific prevalence rates) which allows meaningful comparison of rates between countries.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the method is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966\u2013976 (2015). Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",

  "NUTRITION_ANAEMIA_PREGNANT_PREV": "Rationale: Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentration is used to diagnose anaemia and it is affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. When blood haemoglobin concentrations are used in combination with other indicators of iron status, they provide information about the severity of iron deficiency. The prevalence of anaemia  in a population can be used to classify the public health significance of the problem.\n\nDefinition: Percentage of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.\n\nMethod of measurement: The anaemia status of women is assessed using blood haemoglobin concentrations. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured in surveys using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer (using the azide-methaemoglobin method) in the field.\n\nMethod of estimation: Data on the prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age, collected between 1995 and 2019 were obtained from 408 population-representative data sources from 124 countries worldwide. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin distributions and systematically address missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources.

There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality from NCDs. Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.\n\nDefinition: The percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis. Tobacco products include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, waterpipes (hookah, shisha), bidis, kretek, heated tobacco products, and all forms of smokeless (oral and nasal) tobacco. Tobacco products exclude e-cigarettes (which do not contain tobacco), \u201ce-cigars\u201d, \u201ce-hookahs\u201d, JUUL and \u201ce-pipes\u201d.\n\nMethod of estimation: A statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of current tobacco use for each country, separately for men and women.

Once the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the model was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2025. The model has two main components: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends over time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the completeness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes use of data from other countries to fill information gaps. When a country has fewer than two nationally representative population-based surveys in different years, no attempt is made to fill data gaps and no estimates are calculated. To fill data gaps, information is \u201cborrowed\u201d from countries in the same UN subregion. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single years, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year. In order to make the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO Standard Population. Estimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and such results should be interpreted with caution.",

When this crude prevalence rate is multiplied by the country\u2019s population, the result is the number of current users of any tobacco product in the country. The definition of \"current\" varies between surveys, but often means use of any tobacco product at least once during a defined period leading up to the survey date. Tobacco use includes use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, waterpipes, heated tobacco products, any form of smokeless tobacco (chewed, sucked, nasal) and any other form of tobacco.

Anaemia is associated with poor cognitive and motor development, and work capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anaemia is also associated with adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes.

Replacing industrially produced TFA with healthier oils and fats is cost-effective and feasible, and can be done without changing the taste of food or its cost to the consumer. \nIn May 2018, WHO called for the global elimination of industrially produced TFA by 2023 and released the REPLACE action framework to support countries in implementing the prompt, complete and sustained elimination of industrially produced TFA from the food supply. In May 2019, WHO released six REPLACE modules, which provide practical, step-by-step implementation guidance to support country actions. WHO recommends that countries adopt and implement one of two best-practice policy options for eliminating industrially produced TFA from the global food supply.\n\nDefinition: Country has a policy(ies) or regulatory measure(s) that limit industrially produced TFA in all settings and are in line with the recommended approach. The two best-practice policies for TFA elimination are: 1) mandatory national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced TFA per 100 grams of total fat in all foods; and 2) mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) as an ingredient in all foods.\n\n\u201cYes\u201d if a best-practice is implemented, \u201cNo\u201d if a best-practice is not implemented, or \u201c\uff0d\u201c if there is no data.\n\nIf a country has adopted a best-practice policy, but the policy has not yet come into effect, \"Yes\" is inserted under the expected future year when the policy comes into effect.\n\nMethod of estimation: The indicator is based on TFA country score card available in the WHO Global database on the Implementation of Nutrition Action (GINA) (https://extranet.who.int/nutrition/gina/en/scorecard/TFA).",

The estimate is based on the reconstructed cohort method.  Persistence to last grade of primary is the percentage of children enrolled in the first grade of primary school who eventually reach the last grade of primary education. The estimate is based on the reconstructed cohort method.\n\nMethod of measurement: Cohort survival rate is calculated by dividing the total number of children belonging to a cohort who reached each successive grade of the specified level of education by the number of children in the same cohort; those originally enrolled in the first grade of primary education, and multiplying by 100. To reflect current patterns of grade transition, it is calculated based on the reconstructed cohort method, which uses data on enrollment by grade for the two most recent years and data on repeaters by grade for the most recent of those two years. Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level.

Capacity to pay for health care is defined as total household consumption minus a standard amount to cover basic needs (food, housing and utilities).\n\nMethod of estimation: Catastrophic health spending occurs when the amount a household pays out of pocket exceeds a predefined share of its capacity to pay for health care. This may mean the household can no longer afford to meet other basic needs (for example, food, housing, water, electricity and fuel for cooking and heating) or cannot afford to meet basic needs without drawing on savings, selling assets or borrowing.

The standard amount is calculated as the average amount spent on food, housing (rent) and utilities (water, electricity and fuel used for cooking and heating) by households between the 25th and 35th percentiles of the household consumption distribution who report any spending on each item, respectively, adjusted for household size and composition using OECD equivalence scales. These households are selected based on the assumption that they are able to meet, but not necessarily exceed, basic needs for food, housing and utilities. This standard amount is also used as a poverty line (basic needs line) to measure impoverishing health spending.\n\nDisaggregation: Results are disaggregated into household quintiles by consumption per person using OECD equivalence scales. Disaggregation by place of residence (urban\u2013rural), age or employment status of the head of the household, household composition and other factors is included in country-level and regional-level analysis where relevant.\n\nFinancial protection is measured at the level of the health system rather than at the level of different types of health care, diseases or patient groups.
